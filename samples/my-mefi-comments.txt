<em>Oh and this is only loosely in relation to the article, since it was very long and around the beginning and end.</em><br>
<br>
I would encourage giving the piece another chance since it addresses many of the points you are making here (namely, Ghosh is absolutely not saying we should center animal welfare as the basis for climate action). Of course, if you are in too much of a rush to critically read a relatively short piece, then it seems to illustrate another point that many climate writers and organizers are regularly making: what are the systems above you that force you into such a rush?<br>
<br>
I particularly like this line (and it has nothing to do with &quot;a focus on animal welfare&quot;):
<blockquote>The current ubiquity of the word brutality is an indication of a stunning reversal: no longer is this domain of meaning configured around the savage or the semicivilized; it is centered instead on the repressive machinery of the state, primarily the police. The inversion of meaning establishes an etymological arc that links the planetary crisis directly back to processes of colonization, enslavement, and biopolitical war.</blockquote>

<br>
Banning grey market economies leads to those affected workers turning to black market economies, which ironically makes it far more likely for abuse, violence, and exploitation to happen (see...human trafficking and the war on drugs).<br>

<blockquote>[W]e find evidence that ERS significantly reduced female homicide rates by as much as 10-17 percent. We do not find evidence that this was a more general reduction in homicide, as ERS is unrelated to male murder, females killed by an intimate partner, or manslaughters. This strengthens our assessment that ERS-driven changes in sex markets were the primary driver of the reduction in female murders.</blockquote>

<em>Let me introduce you to the stinking turd left by the Trump administration: FOSTA-SESTA.</em><br>
<br>
I think it is really important to not pin this solely on the Trump Administration. An insufficient analysis makes it so much harder to do anything about a broken system.<br>
<br>
Throwing sex workers under the bus is one of the few intersections of bipartisan collaboration left in modern American politics. <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&session=2&vote=00060#position">97 senators voted yea on H.R. 1865 (including Booker, Harris, Sanders, and Warren)</a>.<br>
<br>
The only two that voted nay? Ron Wyden and...Rand Paul (lol broken clocks).<br>
<br>
The OF news is directly related to FOSTA/SESTA (and the generally inequitable <a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/key-topics/aml">AML laws/regulations set by the US government</a>). Like banks, payment processors like Visa and Mastercard are highly incentivized to be as <em>conservative</em> as possible when it comes to who they take money from because federal and state regulators love nothing more than fucking over sex workers, drug dealers (who aren't the Sackler family), and anyone else who operates outside of the modern capitalist economy.<br>
<br>
I don't understand why people are surprised or upset by this. &quot;Anti-trafficking&quot; laws are far more about hurting working-class immigrants and sex workers than actually doing anything about the systems of inequity that enable trafficking to occur in the first place.

<em>The planet's not dying, it's seen much worse before and will be fine. Humans are the ones that will die.</em><br>
<br>
Even with very incomplete attribution modeling, <b><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-07/climate-change-linked-to-5-million-deaths-a-year-new-study-shows">millions of humans have already died</a></b>. And it's not just humans who are already dying, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/24/13596">it is all manner of life</a>:
<blockquote>We examine 29,400 species of terrestrial vertebrates, and determine which are on the brink of extinction because they have fewer than 1,000 individuals. There are 515 species on the brink (1.7% of the evaluated vertebrates). Around 94% of the populations of 77 mammal and bird species on the brink have been lost in the last century. Assuming all species on the brink have similar trends, more than 237,000 populations of those species have vanished since 1900. We conclude the human-caused sixth mass extinction is likely accelerating for several reasons. First, many of the species that have been driven to the brink will likely become extinct soon. Second, the distribution of those species highly coincides with hundreds of other endangered species, surviving in regions with high human impacts, suggesting ongoing regional biodiversity collapses. Third, close ecological interactions of species on the brink tend to move other species toward annihilation when they disappear—extinction breeds extinctions. Finally, human pressures on the biosphere are growing rapidly, and a recent example is the current coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, linked to wildlife trade. Our results reemphasize the extreme urgency of taking much-expanded worldwide actions to save wild species and humanity’s crucial life-support systems from this existential threat.</blockquote>

Yes, in tens or hundreds of millions of years, the beauty of biodiversity will eventually come back to this planet. But it won't be us or anything we know today (except for maybe cockroaches and mosquitos).

It is very unfortunate that old articles from months or even years ago are being shared here as evidence that &quot;things are not as bad as you think&quot;.

The lens I'm using is a post-colonial one created by post-colonial South Asian and African feminist writers, researchers, and organizers.<br>

Would Hindu nationalism exist in its current form without partition? Would people be more or less receptive to its message if the economic growth in India wasn't so deeply lopsided as a result of decades of neoliberal collaboration by the Congress Party?<br>

<br>
I'll add to this and say to all the westerners aghast at the staggering cruelty and incompetence of a religious fascist government facing a pandemic they can't fearmonger away (sound familiar?): this is the price of all the wonderful benefits your countries have parasitically extracted via centuries of colonialism and decades of bipartisan neoliberalism. While none of you have explicitly wanted this and much of this began even before most of us were born, this has been done in your name for decades by both the leaders you love and the leaders you hate.<br>
<br>
This is the price of collegiality in the face of Western hegemony, of racial capitalism, and of the pathetic incremental liberal reforms to these evil superstructures advocated by the most profoundly sheltered and paradoxically fragile people on Earth. This is the price of not knowing your history and why your clothing is so cheap. This is the price of not asking &quot;why the fuck is so much art and treasure from all around the world in western museums&quot;. This is the price of not knowing where the word &quot;loot&quot; comes from.<br>

And to make matters worse, that price is being paid by the already deeply marginalized. I have already lost family to this and there does not seem to be an end in sight. I try to moderate my tone in primarily white/western spaces because the absolute despair and rage I feel doesn't help anyone, but self-policing my tone doesn't seem to actually lead to people paying attention or understanding why things happen the way they do.

I think I understand the interlocking systems of physics, chemistry, and ecology well enough to understand some significant amount of suffering is already baked in thanks to the decades-long bipartisan collaboration of liberals and conservatives doing nothing meaningful about climate change, but it is clear there is a lot that can be done without throwing away the lives of billions of people of color under starvation and inundation (or thinking that massive world wars will magically lead to a better world?).<br>
<br>
To pull from the article:
<blockquote>Those 17 scientists did not want you to despair. “Ours is not a call to surrender,” they wrote. It was meant as a kick in the ass—a reminder that our only chance is a thoroughgoing transformation. Specifically: “fundamental changes to global capitalism, education, and equality, which include inter alia the abolition of perpetual economic growth.” Radical as this call may seem, it was hardly an outlier demand from a few oddball pinko Ph.Ds. In 2019, 11,258 scientists from 153 countries signed a “Warning of a Climate Emergency” that called for “bold and drastic” changes to the economy, including a shift away “from GDP growth and the pursuit of affluence toward sustaining ecosystems and improving human well-being.” Two years before that, the Alliance of World Scientists made a similar call in a “Warning to Humanity” that garnered 15,364 signatures. We are supposed to listen to science now. This is what the scientists are saying: Everything must change.</blockquote>

I am reminded of Donella Meadows's iconic piece, &quot;<a href="http://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/">Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System</a>&quot;. It is understandable to see no way out if all we focus on is the lowest leverage domain of constants, parameters, and numbers. There are no taxation structures or subsidies that can escape the regulatory capture of carbon capital without anything above it moving our entire human world away from endless growth on a limited planet.<br>
<br>
But this piece, along with tens of thousands of climate scientists, offers another way out by jumping above to the more effective points of intervention in this grand system. If that change is scary to people, <a href="https://www.orbitbooks.net/orbit-excerpts/the-ministry-for-the-future/">the first chapter of The Ministry For The Future</a> offers a very realistic forecast into the price of inaction.

<em>I just finished reading The Ministry for the Future, and I recommend it highly. Not because it's a good book -- the writing's fun but uneven, and it's far too long. But it starts out with a hard-eyed look at the sort of events across the mid-21st century that could actually lead to governments taking real action on climate change.</em><br>
<br>
Yes, I think the &quot;adverse weather events&quot; described in that book are not unrealistic forays into climate doomerism, but extremely realistic forecasts of what will actually happen. However, I also think the solutions are realistic even if the political will isn't currently there.<br>
<br>
The resignation and defeatism in some of these comments is remarkable. If you had asked me in 2008 that gay marriage would be a reality in America just 7 years after Prop 8 had just been passed, I wouldn't have believed you, but I would have fought like hell to make it reality (and that's exactly what I did). I have uncles and aunties who are alive today who still bear the literal scars of British colonialism and yet, they are no longer colonized subjects. I don't think they found liberation from white supremacy by sitting back and giving up.<br>

<em>This just seems like a slightly nicer way to say billions will suffer, but we should not care because we can do nothing.

<br>
It is also remarkably telling just how little some people care when the billions who are already suffering the effects of climate change are poor, Black and Brown, and far away from the very comfortable lives of Westerners who are far more interested in propping up straw men about burning down all cities than reckoning with what is happening and what needs to change.<br>

<em>I think gender quotas are the right thing to do, but I’d also like to see corporate boards (and regulatory agency advisory boards) have equal worker representation.</em><br>
<br>
Yes, I agree. It makes sense for worker representation on boards to lead to better outcomes for workers, who tend to be marginalized in terms of gender, race, and other identities as well compared to the rarefied few who ascend to the ranks of shareholder boards.

When it comes to climate change, having children is not the issue. The anti-natalism (and the resulting derail) is frustrating.<br>
<br>
The issue is average emissions per person. After all, people in Bangladesh having children will not create enough GHG emissions to worsen climate change, even as they suffer the worst effects of climate change.<br>
<br>
It will be the middle to upper-class Westerners, particularly Americans (of all races and genders) whose children <em>may</em> end up producing the most significant amount of GHG emissions in our lifetimes. <br>
<br>
But that future emissions metric is entirely variable. Their future emissions impact (and our current impact) is entirely dependent on how rapidly America can decarbonize and begin adopting NETs (and whether their parents and American society will encourage them to pursue the endless-growth carbon-intensive lifestyle of air travel, beef eating, and single-family homeownership that got us into this mess in the first place).<br>
<br>
There is no reproductive freedom under ecological collapse. If people want to have kids, they should be able to have them. And all of the systems above us should support them <em>and</em> make sure that those kids don't have to face ecological collapse.

Because climate change is such a tremendously complex hyperobject, I prefer focusing on systemic change over individual choices. But individual choices like voting matter greatly because they ultimately end up dictating systemic change.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the country with the most power in this situation is comprised of two very large voting blocs that have deluded themselves into either thinking climate change isn't happening <em>or</em> that it is coming slowly enough that reforming the status quo will save the day. The best we can do now will still lead to ecological collapse.<br>
<br>
Once people understand all the feedback loops we have successfully activated (and just how much warming is already baked in and unavoidable), I don't know how anyone can sleep at night, especially the people who have children.<br>

Of course, in saying that, I know exactly how people can (and do) sleep at night.

<br>
It is fascinating how the specific circumstances of this fascist lurch (and Biden's own moderate history/demeanor mixed with his more progressive contemporary policies) mean Biden will hopefully be the perfect candidate to bring in a lot of &quot;moderate&quot; Republicans who are turned off by the fascism of their original party. At the same time, those progressive contemporary policies will continue to help people (even those &quot;moderate&quot; Republicans!) and hopefully create a virtuous cycle.<br>

<em>But I would be super grateful if anyone can help me understand, in a more nuanced or sophisticated way, why both my friend and that stupid cartoonist are full of shit. And if I’m full of shit, tell me.</em><br>
<br>
Well, I don't know any of you (or the offensive and dumb comic in question) so I can't determine the full-of-shittitude of any of the parties involved.<br>
<br>
But if you're interested in my perspective as a young organizer of color, I would ask just how valuable is diversity-by-itself when so many cases of police brutality against people of color have happened in blue cities+blue states where people of color are well represented in the halls of power. How much more PoC representation did Baltimore and Maryland need to have in order to not murder Freddie Gray?<br>
<br>
Or from another angle: why are the most vulnerable populations so brutalized on a daily basis in cities where people of color run the show and conservatives have not held power for decades?<br>
<br>
My personal take is that relatively comfortable and well-meaning people really focus on diversity because they see the systems we live under as oppressive due to bugs that can be addressed with reforms. Unfortunately, this hypothesis has failed miserably over and over again at every level of American government.<br>
<br>
At this point, I don't get excited about a person of color or queer person or woman reaching a level of office unless their politics mean they will actually help marginalized communities (like the ones I am in). So Deb Haaland makes me really happy. But I only have sadness when a woman of color who once joked about prison inmates begging for water becomes someone with a lot of political power. Maybe it's just my radical politics, but I don't think that's a good thing to say, regardless of the race of the joke-teller.<br>
<br>
And if the only people you know who are suspicious/dismissive of identity politics are white conservatives, then I think that speaks more to the racial and political diversity of your relationships and networks than anything else. <a href="https://nonsite.org/author/adolph-reed/">We certainly exist</a>; the problem is that we're not usually friends with the white people who care about these things nor on forums like Metafilter (the overlap is fairly strong between these two circles).

But like you said, it is important to specifically articulate those flaws out for people with power, at least out of a sense of respect for the millions who have suffered in order for those powerful people to get even more power. We do this all the time in this community for rightfully disgraced musicians and filmmakers; I see no reason why &quot;decorum&quot; should be a shield fo people who have caused massive harm to millions or billions of people.<br>

It is a little funny for someone like Colin Powell to talk about ruffians and crooks. It is really depressing that people earnestly believe him and give him a venue to successfully launder his reputation. It reminds me of the recent fawning treatment of George W. Bush <em>for calling out people attempting to steal an election</em>.<br>

<em>I mean, there is a reason that conservative pundits just fucking worship business founders. They truly do just create apparent value out of nothing. Assuming that Amazon shares don't start selling for fifty cents because then $99M evaporates as easily as it appeared.</em><br>
<br>
I mean, that growth of value is only made possible out of the faith that the US government and its systems will not fail (as a result of its massive wealth and military power). This is absolutely not &quot;nothing&quot;, even though the defenders of the immensely wealthy desperately wish it was.<br>
<br>
This is one of the most fascinating paradoxes of conservatives, especially libertarians. They worship something that can only exist as a result of immense government intervention (even as they fight ceaselessly to make the government less effective at securing that value for the hyper-wealthy).

<em>Re: our freshly invigorated intra-Left sparring, I warmly imagine us as a team trying to help each other climb a very high cliff. I find it helpful once in a while, when we reach a small foothold, to look back down the hill and take a brief moment's satisfaction at how far we've come - before continuing the arduous, important climb.<br>
<br>
The guy trying to pull the rope down is a complete asshole and we don't need to talk about him. But it's also challenging when a member of our own team can't let some of us acknowledge our progress thus far, just for a couple of minutes while we catch our breath.</em><br>
<br>
I think the issue is this analogy falls apart because there really isn't one team. There are lots of different groups with very different priorities and equally divergent views of history, the current reality, and the future.<br>
<br>
As a result, one group's idea of a small foothold or a brief moment's satisfaction is very different from another group's ideas of the same thing, never mind the far greater divergence in what all these groups view as reaching the summit. This dynamic becomes even more amplified and charged when there are stark differences in marginalization and privilege. Hell, <em>there are groups that proudly used to do the marginalizing</em>. Some still do.<br>
<br>
But I don't think that this variety is inherently a problem. Politics and organizing are both ultimately systems of navigating compromises and persuading others who have different beliefs and priorities. Given what a lot of people of color, particularly organizers, have been through over the last three decades, I hope it is understandable that many of us can celebrate <em>and</em> worry at the same time (even if the proportions may be wildly different from the people who are feeling mostly unadulterated joy).<br>
<br>
That said, the more executive orders Biden signs to overturn Trump's awfulness (and correct the awfulness that came before), I might just start feeling a small sense of joy sooner than later. Fortunately for my own health, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/535071-biden-to-sign-executive-orders-on-climate-health-care-immigration-in">it's looking like he will</a>.

<em>Social media websites can also be seen as a printing press that is available to the public, but the twist is that they also are the method of dissemination of the content of their printing press. It isn't contingent on the creator to generate interest -- the platform itself promotes and creates interest. That's vastly different from the days of &quot;get your own printing press&quot;.</em><br>
<br>
If that's the distinction, then social media companies would simply have to disable the algorithms they use to boost engagement/sort user timelines and they would be in the clear. I don't think that's the intended result any of us want (since it actually doesn't solve the issues of disinformation/fascism propagation we want them to solve).<br>
<br>
Interestingly enough, I think a lot of users would claim to be in favor of that (even though the companies have all the evidence they need to show how users actually end up preferring algorithmic timelines vs chronological timelines).

I think ad-driven/network-effect-driven social media has been a gigantic mistake and I would support any way to permanently destroy them, but repealing Section 230 as it is would also kill many small sites (like Metafilter, for example) because there is a massive asymmetry in effort between posting things that would get a site in trouble in a post-230 world vs <em>cleaning up</em> those same things, even if you give sites an hour or a day or even a week to clean that content up.<br>

<em>How Black Americans are able to live in the US with all the racism and discrimination they experience on a daily basis and not arm themselves and take to the streets in a violent revolution is honestly a miracle.

<br>
To be fair, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_Party">they did</a>. And despite doing nothing at all close to what happened yesterday, they were so brutally repressed and wiped out that even otherwise very informed people forgot about this critical history.<br>

<em>ouverture &amp; others asked upthread who is helped by this type of internet pile-on. I wrote a comment earlier sharing what I think the benefits of this type of outcry are. It's about changing our culture to stop accepting, condoning, and normalizing child abuse -- bigger than one person. People in this thread have shared how healing it is for them to see so many strangers standing up against child abuse. There are other child abuse survivors who have shared how this discussion has helped them see what they still need to do better as parents themselves.</em><br>
<br>
As a survivor of severe physical child abuse <em>and</em> someone who has worked for years with thousands of survivors of child abuse, I am not seeing how this is actually changing our culture instead of moving the parameters of acceptable social discussion for semi-famous online people. I am genuinely glad other people feel healing, but I don't feel that at all. I just feel incredibly concerned and sad for the daughter.<br>
<br>
I want to believe these incidents actually change things for the better. But the last decade of online activism in many fields has not been very convincing for me (although unfortunately, it seems to have worked wonders for conservatives).<br>
<br>
As far as I can tell, the greatest trick Twitter ever pulled was convincing people that yelling at each other is a form of activism and not being Jack Dorsey's unpaid intern that makes him the vast majority of his money.<br>
<br>
<em>And even the one person at the center of it all is likely to have been helped. The next time bean daughter is hungry, I bet anything the effects of having lived through this clap back will be at the top of bean dad's mind. I'm sure he's going to think twice before deciding to keep her hungry ever again. He still might, he might even do it out of sheet spite, but that little moment of reflection is now going to be part of his decision process. That moment is EVERYTHING. Any psychologist and any mindfulness coach will tell you how sacred that moment of pause and reflection is. That is the moment in which change begins.</em><br>
<br>
This does not match my professional experience; when a household experiences intense stress and isolation, this does not lead to better outcomes for the children in that household in the short-term. It is the same reason why so many activists are fighting to reform CPS services and protocols so the priority is materially helping the family holistically so the child can live a better life.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, my primary issue isn't anyone in the pile-on or even people who enjoy pile-ons. The primary responsibility is on Roderick for opening this can of worms (pun intended) and for network-effect-obsessed tech companies like Twitter for enabling and profiting off of this misery.

<em>Essentially, I wonder what people want when something like this happens.</em><br>
<br>
I'd also love to know what people want to see happen and how mass social media outrage actually helps the daughter in this case.<br>
<br>
All I can see is that mass public social media is a god damn mistake. Maybe a few people learned that this is not a good way to be a parent, but it seems far more likely that thousands of people learned that <em>this is not a good thing to share online.</em><br>
<br>
In that light, it's funny seeing the triumphalism here. But then again, it's understandable that people who spend lots of time with a certain kind of online engagement desperately want to believe that what they are doing is actually making a difference.

<em>Gonna go out on a limb and say perhaps, like most parents, Mr. Roderick knows his daughter better than we do, knows where the lines are, knows her learning style, knows how to judge the tone in her voice, and knows when he's gone too far. We can't know that from a few mostly likely embellished tweets.</em><br>
<br>
I want to believe this, but his subsequent defensiveness and generally awful behavior since the story makes me think this isn't an isolated incident being decontextualized and misread. The way he talks about his young daughter to an audience of tens of thousands of people only makes it worse.<br>
<br>
That said, based on my own experiences and trauma, there is a pretty gigantic gap between &quot;bordering on abuse&quot; and &quot;shitty parenting practices&quot;.

<br>
I think this will be the decade that sensible progressive reforms to capitalism, as dictated by neoliberalism's finest technocrats, will really take off. Sure, we are still feeling the devastating effects of the 2008 financial crisis combined with decades of suffering compounded by white supremacy, but considering these technocrats are still very much in power, that obviously indicates the strength of their credibility.<br>

<em>&quot;Maybe sit one out, you're take is upsetting me,&quot; isn't exactly an invitation to a nuanced discussion. On a site where &quot;let marginalized voices be heard&quot; is holy writ, its like going to church and watching the congregation burn the bibles and piss in the holy water.</em><br>
<br>
The interesting thing is that this discussion, like many other discussions over the past 10 years, <em>validates</em> this innovative, uniquely American project of melding a specific kind of diversity-focused identity politics with the great machine of empire. Other than the mass &quot;decarbonizations&quot; in Yemen and Libya, I think this form of reputational laundering will ultimately be Obama's greatest foreign policy legacy.<br>
<br>
After all, how can anyone criticize <em>a person of color</em> or <em>a woman</em> for the terrible things they have done abroad when &quot;the other side&quot;, made up mostly of white men, has done so much worse?<br>
<br>
I would say I see a future of white people condescendingly lecturing me about how racism means people of color in leadership positions inevitably have to do Bad Centrist Things, but I'm already living in that dismal world right now.<br>
<br>
It doesn't matter that I'm a person of color or an organizer or that my family is materially impacted by these things. It turns out identity and circumstances are only useful as a shield against criticism for the powerful, not those without power. I just need to shut up/&quot;sit this one out&quot; because the Americans are traumatized and don't have the spoons for my constant, &quot;bad-faith&quot; uppity behavior.<br>
<br>
The particulars of the drone program are especially interesting: Obama had to personally sign off on each strike, knowing that innocent children would invariably be killed. I desperately wish he would write about those hard choices, especially considering these were unilateral decisions that weren't affected by Republican obstructionism. So far, the only thing he has ever said about it was a horrifying joke about the Jonas Brothers.

<br>
Certainly! But even if I adopt the lens of only considering Obama's legacy as it relates only to Americans, the Obama years do not indicate any sort of preternatural competency for politics or long-lasting material success to actually celebrate.<br>
<br>
Most people's lives did not get materially better in those 8 years. The economy came back, but the workers did not. There were small victories for sure, but god, the long-term structural failures, particularly on the level of winning elections, for both Obama and the Democrats are damning (and we are still suffering through them).<br>
<br>
As Ta-Nehisi Coates has talked about before, it is a real sublime form of unaccountability to take credit for all the good things you did (ACA, gay marriage, consent decrees), but then disavow all the bad things you also did because that's just how the system is (take your pick).<br>

I learned a lot about the limits of identity politics. And I agree that a lot of liberal Obama worship is tiring, but what can ya do?</em><br>
<br>
Sigh, yeah. I consider <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/140245/obamas-lost-army-inside-fall-grassroots-machine">the dismantling of OFA</a> as one of the greatest mistakes made by Democrats in living memory. I still wonder what the 2010 midterms and subsequent races would have looked like if the grassroots machine still existed. Shit, I might still be a liberal.<br>
<br>
One of Obama's greatest gifts to a whole lot of millennials, especially those of us who are QTPOC, was a clear demonstration of just how identity politics, collegiality, and gentle reforms can't take you. Hooray, we got gay marriage and a couple consent decrees, but trans kids are still starving and homeless and the cops are still beating and killing us.<br>
<br>
For that knowledge, I am genuinely grateful.

<br>
Apologies, I don't mean to be so negative.<br>
<br>
Looking at it creatively, Obama's most significant and positive legacy is his contribution to fighting climate change: the lack of economic recovery in America, his humane scaling up of immigrant deportation and refugee denial, and the mandatory mass de-industrialization of Yemen and Libya provided significant emissions reductions that helped offset the next four years of Trump's pro-climate change agenda.

<br>
I don't think anyone has said that nor do I expect that. However, I am extremely tired of the vast gap between the liberal/centrist worship of our first president of color and the material reality of his legacy on people of color. It is identity politics and partisanship at a particularly distressing angle.<br>
<br>
Then again, this is the same sort of polite society that rehabilitates George W. Bush and David Frum.

That he made his decisions with only the best intentions of his fellow country people in mind says it all, doesn't it?<br>
<br>
Obama is a tragic figure at best. The endless liberal worship is so depressing and speaks to just how limited Western analysis of white supremacy really is and how deeply complicit all these systems are in the brutalization of people of color inside and outside America.<br>
<br>
Will there be chapters on the cages he built? The villages he leveled? I would be very much interested in reading that. I don't understand his reticence either; it's not like he will ever be held accountable for his atrocities anyway.<br>

<em>Note that this is not an endorsement of US military action, just a recognition that those in charge of it are not stupid and can make serious plans for the climate catastrophe, at least within the context of their militaristic worldview.</em><br>
<br>
I understand this line of reasoning, but my point is that the bipartisan imperialistic worldview, which I include civilian leadership in this, is fundamentally incompatible with any sort of meaningful progress against climate change.<br>

http://www.metafilter.com/189362/If-guys-with-guns-are-talking-about-collapse-why-cant-we#8014890
One of the many paradoxes of bipartisan American empire is that the military can claim to take climate change seriously while <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/military-climate-change-cycle">still being a massive contributor to it</a>:
<blockquote>According to the Costs of War, an ongoing project from the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University, since the global war on terror began in 2001, the U.S. military has produced 1.2 billion metric tons of greenhouse-gas emissions, or as much as 257 million passenger cars annually, roughly as many registered vehicles as there are in the entire U.S. That's a higher annual output than whole countries like Morocco, Sweden, and Switzerland. The total emissions from war-related activity in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, and Syria is estimated at more than 400 million metric tons of carbon dioxide alone.</blockquote>

It is also why I don't take those claims very seriously.

It's a bit funny to talk about the left being the absolute worst at sloganeering and then offering a slogan that would never gain any traction in real communities.

<br>
Well, I think the standard left-wing take is that there is an immense amount of support for leftist policies like universal healthcare and wealth redistribution and that Democrats just need to shed their neoliberal cowardice and run on these policies in order to win. That's certainly what I believed up until a few months ago (and this interview was one of the reasons why I shifted my beliefs on that).<br>
<br>
Shor's analysis is different and what happened in Florida is an indicator for how it just isn't about people and policy, but also messaging and credibility.

<em>It only works if you actually believe that the party selling it to you is going to do it.</em><br>
<br>
Yeah, the credibility gap for Democrats is immense. No matter who is in office, a whole lot of people's lives have not materially improved in decades. This is especially true for what should be the most engaged base for Democrats: young people, poor people, and people of color (and this deprivation is compounded with each intersecting identity).<br>
<br>
One of the bigger problems is that the party, along with the media in general, is led by people whose lives have generally gotten better over time. As this gap continues to widen, Republicans will continue to siphon off support from the above three segments, just as they did in this year's election.

<br>
The above partisanship distorting some <em>very</em> recent history is pretty fascinating. It's not that Obama failed to &quot;shutdown the drone strikes&quot;, but that just like the great deportation and immigration detention machine, Obama used his competency to scale <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/obama-secret-kill-list-disposition-matrix">the drone murder program</a> up only to let Trump really commit all kinds of horror with it (and with less transparency, naturally).<br>
<br>
I'm still confused as to why Obama <em>had</em> to murder a 16-year old American citizen without trial though. At least Abdulrahman was fortunate enough to be instantly vaporized by a hyper-competent American president of color instead of his 8-year old sister, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/01/30/obama-killed-a-16-year-old-american-in-yemen-trump-just-killed-his-8-year-old-sister/">who suffered for two hours</a> before dying due to the cruder military operation undertaken by a cruder and less competent fascist conservative white American president.<br>

<em>Me too. And in fact I do see signs of counterfactual, conspiracy-oriented thinking among some on the left. For example, there's a whole swath of leftists who insist that the DNC somehow rigged the primaries against Bernie to install Biden as the nominee. When you explain to these people that no, actually, Biden was the front-runner pretty much the whole time, and he won because traditional Dem constituencies -- especially older black voters -- overwhelmingly supported him, they scoff. Their fact-free, situationally convenient cynicism about election outcomes is really no different from that of Trump and his followers.</em><br>

I have always felt uncomfortable with the idea that leftists and liberals are &quot;smarter&quot; than conservatives and that's why leftists and liberals don't get so easily snookered into misinformation.

<br>
Right? I wish I could live in a world where racists don't enjoy the food of people of color. It would be a decent karmic punishment for their prejudice.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.ocweekly.com/mexican-food-defeated-america-now-mexicans-in-america-will-defeat-sb-1070-6422338/">Relevant article from one of my favorite food writers</a>:
<blockquote>A couple of years ago, I put four white supremacists in prison. They had made the mistake of going into the Slater Slums of Huntington Beach, California, the city's traditional barrio, to kill a random Mexican. They got as far as stabbing a man before the Slater Slums smackdown began: The community came out of their apartments and kicked the shit out of the KKKlowns — a beatdown of wonderful, ironic proportions. Not a single Mexican was arrested; the Candy Ass Gang, as we called them, went away for years, convicted on hate crimes.<br>
<br>
I discovered that the crime was premeditated, announced on a white-power Internet radio show weeks earlier. But I also discovered that the attackers loved Mexican food: A bunch of pictures a source forwarded to me showed the pendejos in various states of devouring burritos and tacos from Del Taco, the Mexican fast-food chain that's known for being better than that Taco Bell mierda.<br>
<br>
Race traitors? Hardly. Just following American policy: Hate the Mexican, love the Mexican food, assault the Mexican, get your ass handed to you by Mexicans. This has been America's experience with Mexicans, a cycle of justice that must be remembered when considering what's happening to this country right now in the wake of SB 1070 and its many copycats. Those politicians, judges, and voters who pass law after law trying to stop Mexicans from asserting themselves in this country, are like King Canute commanding the tide to stop: The game is already over. We beat you with our Mexican food long ago, and we're going to beat you on SB 1070, as well.</blockquote>

(By contrast, only about 6 in 10 Clinton voters earned more than $50,000 a year.)</blockquote>

<em>What's pointless is using this technique for persuading voters while canvassing.</em><br>
<br>
Why is this pointless? As The Atlantic article points out:
<blockquote>So far, more than 3 percent of the voters we’ve engaged have switched from planning to vote for Donald Trump to planning to vote for Joe Biden. Even more significant, 8.5 percent of women independents—and 4.9 percent of women overall—said they planned to change their vote to Biden.<strong> David Broockman and Josh Kalla, academics who measure what helps shift hearts and minds, told me this persuasion rate is 102 times more effective than traditional electioneering efforts aimed at persuading people to change their vote</strong>. <strong>On average, these exchanges took 15 minutes.</strong></blockquote>

And from the Rolling Stone article:
<blockquote>Broockman and Kalla had studied at Yale University under the renowned political scientists Alan Gerber and Donald Green, who had pioneered the use of field experiments in politics to measure what actually works to persuade potential voters. <strong>In their own research, Broockman and Kalla ran experiments using the traditional tools of politics — short phone calls, brief door-to-door canvassing, and TV ads — and found that they typically had almost no lasting effect on changing the mind of a typical voter</strong>.<br>
<br>
But the experiments that Broockman, who now teaches at the University of California, Berkeley, and Kalla, who teaches at Yale, ran involving deep canvassing told a different story. They’ve now conducted half a dozen major studies and, each time, as the data come in, they find measurable effects on prejudice and certain public policies that last much longer than the TV ads and short-form canvassing. One of the key ingredients, they say, is stories — about a marginalized group of people, about a time you were treated differently, but really any personal story. Another was showing respect to the person on the other end of the conversation, no matter how much you disliked or disagreed with them. “We just kept finding in study after study these results,” Broockman says. “Every time we do this, we seem to find this again and again and again.”</blockquote>

I don't think 100% of every campaign's effort and funding should be focused on deep canvassing (I don't think anyone has said that?), but as the research shows, it can be a critical tool. And given the intense Pareto effect in swing states and districts, what does it matter if it can scale or not?<br>
<br>
Do you have any data that indicates it is actually &quot;pointless&quot;?

It's also important to note that you don't need to win 100% of voters over. In America, electoral victories are binary: one side either got more votes than the other side, or they didn't. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/swing-state-margins/">Some elections can be decided by a relative handful of votes</a>.<br>
<br>
I did not realize people were interpreting this as an exhortation to go do this. If you don't want to or can't or whatever, please don't. But it is useful information to have, even outside of elections.<br>
<br>
For example, I have met so many white liberals and leftists who brag to me about how they don't talk to their families anymore because of their racism. And I'm just like...fuck, <em>why don't you</em>? I get those conversations are hard, but you know what's worse? Living under white supremacy and racial capitalism.

<em>If it was, we'd truly be screwed. There's no way anyone can engage with so. many. people. at a personal level, create camaraderie and intimacy with them, allow them to process the underlying reasons for their political opinions enough that the ugliness inherent becomes apparent to them, build enough safety that they can acknowledge the ugliness, and form a strong enough relationship that motivates them to change. That's literally therapy and there's a reason it costs a lot of money! Motivational interviewing is slow, painstaking work that can usually only be done by professionals with advanced degrees.</em><br>
<br>
As the articles point out, deep canvassing is not done by professionals with advanced degrees. It also does not take hours upon hours.<br>
<br>
I also don't disagree with you about the role of foreign propaganda. But I don't understand why this is being framed as a mutually exclusive, zero-sum issue. Nor does it address the fact that a lot of the worst aspects of the current reactionary moment, like Q Anon, are largely homegrown and don't need foreign influence. They will also be around a lot longer than Trump will.<br>
<br>
It's funny how everyone's minds go straight to the most right-wing Republican imaginable. What about all the people who don't vote?<br>
<br>
Moreover, Democrats have had a larger voter base than Republicans for a long time. But due to the electoral college, voter suppression, and gerrymandering, just how much good has that done for us?

<em>At best, it seems to me like a partial solution: we can heal, slowly but surely, but only if we stop the ongoing damage first.</em><br>
<br>
I mean, to reflect this back to you, how do you propose we stop the ongoing damage? It isn't as though Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, or worse, Facebook/Twitter radicalization bubbles are going away just because we desperately want them to. And to take away the focus from committed conservative voters, there is still a gigantic population of undecided and unengaged voters that cannot be reached by traditional electioneering. The importance of persuading people who aren't already on board is even more important given the state of gerrymandering and voter suppression across much of the country.<br>
<br>
The defeatism is striking; what is the other alternative? Retreat into blue state bastions and write off all the poor people, queer people, and people of color who can't afford to move out of proto-Gilead as we experience ecological collapse?<br>
<br>
Maybe it's easier for white people or white men to do this work...but isn't that what we have been asking of them since forever? To use their privilege for good? Besides, as a queer person of color, my own experiences in leftist organizing have taught me that people, even the most regressive ones, are far more persuadable than liberal leaders have long said otherwise.<br>
<br>
None of these articles say this was going to be easy. But I would love to hear what the alternative is.

<br>
I have no evidence that this coup was over lithium; I imagine the more likely reason is the banal evil of the domestic right-wing white minority sensing a moment to seize power away from a party that successfully represented the interests of long oppressed and underrepresented indigenous and poor people in Bolivia. It is depressing to me how excited I feel when I see so many people vote for their material interests.<br>

<em>The single most consequential step that the US can take right now toward mitigating climate change is depriving that fucker of his job, which it has a real opportunity to do less than two weeks from now. So sure, hold Biden's feet to the fire on climate change but do that once he's certain to hold office. Unless and until that happens, the difference between Biden and Trump on climate is so stark that there is zero upside in publishing articles that might have even a vague chance of helping swing the election in Trump's favour.</em><br>
<br>
I'm voting for Biden and Harris because I see no other choice forward. Biden's currently insufficient plan of ecological hospice is still better than Trump's plan of actively fascist ecological collapse. Even in the worst case scenario, the difference might only be a few decades, but that's still a few decades of life under tragic, heartbreaking decay instead of outright, malevolent death. I'll be getting up early to go to my polling place to cast my ballot despite being in multiple high-risk groups for COVID-19. I'm casting my ballot fully well understanding the best possible option means the only choice still means fighting even harder than I have ever fought in my life if Biden hopefully wins.<br>
<br>
I posted this on Metafilter because I think it is an incredibly important thing to discuss in a space where I do not see a chance of it affecting people's voting behavior. There is a stickied, direct endorsement of Biden and Harris on the header of every page on Metafilter. I want to think that it has far more influence than my post two days later (and likely even more an effect than a small site like Current Affairs could hope to have).<br>
<br>
These conversations leave me extremely disheartened for what happens after Biden hopefully wins. The singular focus on Trump (instead of Republicans as a whole and the Democrats who enable, praise, and collegially hug them) and the rise of the Lincoln Project over the last four years indicates to me that for many, many people, Trump is indeed the only problem we ever need to worry about in terms of actually protesting in the streets as though their lives depended on it. 4 years is a long time to wait for brunch, after all.<br>

<em>Tellingly, there is no content. You posted a lightweight article that doesn't talk about policy in any significant way.</em> <br>
<br>
I have to disagree. These sections are what I really liked about the article and how it went into the significant flaws in Biden's plan:
<blockquote><strong>Don’t Leave It in the Ground</strong>.<br>
<br>
<strong>What Is NET Worth?</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Winning the Century, Losing the World</strong></blockquote>

If 1,400 words (and plenty of links to other sources) on Biden's plan alone isn't enough on the topic, then I don't know what counts as &quot;substance&quot; for you. <br>
<br>
Biden's plan is actually really interesting because of its heavy reliance on NETs that don't exist yet. In some ways, it is an incredibly radical plan because it hedges the entire survival of the human species on the possibility that we might be able to make billions, if not trillions, of carbon scrubbers and other massive geoengineering projects.<br>

<em>Yeah, like this article couldn't have come out November 4th? Bull. Shit. The timing is not a coincidence.</em><br>
<br>
So what is it then? What dark, sinister forces have led to this article being published? Are they of a...<em>Russian nature</em>?<br>
<br>
Allow me to reiterate, for the kids in the back row: if this article was posted on November 4th, it would have been too soon because of likely election news chaos. <em>The stakes would be too high</em> to disturb such a fragile moment in time. If this article was posted after Biden's hopeful inauguration, it would have been too soon because the Democrats need all the party unity they can get because oh, don't you know, we have to worry about the midterms. <em>The stakes would be too high</em> to disturb such a fragile moment in time. Do we wait after the midterms? Oh goodness no, because we have re-election to worry about. Next thing we know, it's 2028 and even though Biden has done nothing about fossil fuel extraction, we just can't bring it up because the stakes are going to be too high and Democrats don't want to alienate the white moderate boomer voters in Pennsylvania again.<br>
<br>
This chastising of leftists and progressives is what happened under Obama. It helped suck out much of the energy out of room for leftist agitation during the Obama years because the stakes were always too high. For those who actually read the article, this was the result under Obama:
<blockquote>Indeed, even as the prospects for preventing the most apocalyptic scenarios dwindle, and as paying pecksniffian obeisance to the “existential crisis” has for Democrats grown increasingly de rigueur, Obama’s ecocidal boasting has continued unabated. In November 2018—the month after the IPCC defined the necessity of immediate and drastic greenhouse gas emissions requiring “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society”— Obama referred to the “rising energy output under [my] watch and sudden talk of America’s leading role in oil and gas production,” and beamed “That was me, people. Just say thank you.” </blockquote>

This is the electoral version of a tone argument. The issue isn't timing, it's the actual content (that, tellingly, very few people here seem to want to engage with). And it stinks of the immense privilege of people who will not face climate change's worst consequences for a relatively long time.

<br>
I mean, I agree there is still hope, but it is hope <em>despite</em> Biden's incrementalist climate change plan, not as a result of it.<br>
<br>
The hope is that massive progressive/leftist energy forces Biden to not follow Obama down the woke ecocidal pathway despite all the resistance by the fossil fuel industry and incrementalist liberals and centrists who love the status quo.<br>

This reads like a gender-flipped version of &quot;not all men&quot;. Yes, plenty of upper-middle-class white women did not vote for Trump, but crucially, a hell of a lot of them did because, as this article points out, there were very material and real benefits in doing so (and doing so again in 2020).<br>
<br>
This piece is excellent and I wish there were more like it:
<blockquote>That sort of conditioning to instability leads to all sorts of decisions. Some people look outward, for a way to change the society that has fostered that precarity. And some respond by looking inward, frantically trying to maintain what they’ve carved out for themselves. That turn inward is often facilitated by overtly and covertly racist ideas about poverty, addiction, crime, prison, education, and so much more. But the animating principle: self-preservation. Of class position, of course, but also placement in the racial hierarchy, dominance of religious beliefs, and general worldview. They want to maintain the status quo because, at least in this moment, it continues to favor them.</blockquote>

Of course, this is what leftist people of color have been saying for decades. The suburbs have always been a rotten, corrosive place. But maybe a white woman like Anne Helen Petersen has more credibility with the white mainstream audience that so desperately needs to understand this.

I don't really mind in terms of what he says on the campaign as long as he doesn't go slow on climate change as previous Democratic administrations have done.

<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/159398/anne-helen-petersen-millennials-burnout">Ah, here we go</a>:
<blockquote>Although Petersen’s synthesis of the existing literature is cogent and clear, and although her anecdotal reporting nicely complements the studies she cites, little of what she writes is new or surprising. What is new is her argument that all of this—the need to work constantly, which began for millennials in childhood and never stopped—can be summed up with a diagnosis of “burnout.” Our generational affliction is more than poverty or precarity; it is endless fatigue. Can’t Even is convincingly argued, but it raises a question: Is a psychological diagnosis really appropriate for such a varied, and fundamentally economic, affliction?<br>
<br>
When Petersen’s original “burnout” essay appeared in the first days of 2019, a number of writers of color chimed in to note that burnout operates differently for them than it does for Petersen, who identifies as white. “For millennials of color, not only do we have to combat endless emails and Slack notifications,” wrote Tiana Clark in a widely publicized response, “but we also get strapped with having to prove our humanity inside and outside of the workplace and classroom.” To her credit, Petersen clearly strove to include voices from a wide array of backgrounds in her book, often noting the racially and economically disparate impacts of current and historical drivers of burnout. “Decentering the white middle-class millennial experience as the millennial experience is an ongoing and essential aspect of this project,” she writes in the book’s introduction. She also periodically notes how burnout is experienced differently by undocumented millennials, disabled millennials, poor and working-class millennials, and queer millennials. Especially in her chapter on “The Exhausted Millennial Parent,” she delves into how burnout is experienced differently (and more intensely) by women than by men.</blockquote>

Generational cohorts exist and the differences are real, even if there has always been plenty of deprivation to go around. It is bizarre to me to look at the wildly disparate homeownership rates, productivity/pay gaps, credential inflation, and the cost of higher education over time and think &quot;nope, millennials have not been uniquely exploited and fucked over&quot;.<br>
<br>
It is also so <em>weird</em> that these articles/interviews don't more deeply go into the role of capitalism into all of this. Yes, the internet/social media/Boomer parenting all play a big role in the burnout, but at the end of the day, so much of it goes back to capitalism.<br>
<br>
It's like acknowledging villagers are disappearing but pretending the giant Lovecraftian demon god hovering in the sky has nothing to do with said disappearances.

<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/159431/ruth-bader-ginsburg-end-one-great-woman-myth">Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the End of the One Great Woman Myth</a>:
<blockquote>For some time, though, reproductive justice advocates and those working on abortion funds had been sounding the alarm, urging abortion rights defenders to turn their attentions to the states, and to better resourcing the grassroots work of women of color in the places where a slate of new laws had made the right to an abortion, long the purview of privileged white women, little more than an abstraction for poor women. The disconnect between large, national reproductive rights organizations and their (now publicly documented) institutional racism was interconnected with the online media feminist shakeup that produced the RBG meme. This image of Ginsburg was a triumph of branded feminism, and a bid—for some who drove it—to turn away from a feminist reckoning over race and class and entrust their freedom in one of the only women in the United States with a job for life.<br>
<br>
What conception of women’s rights, and what kind of feminist movement, might have died with Ginsburg? Fear of the end of legal abortion rightly fuels many women’s mourning, a pre-wake for an idea of Roe as the most significant indicator of the status of women’s freedom. But we still have Roe, now, and yet we are faced with the continued neglect and abuse of women in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers, with the police who kill Black women like Breonna Taylor with apparent impunity.</blockquote>

I am devastated beyond words for her family, for the marginalized communities I am a part of, and for this country.<br>
<br>
I sorely wished RGB retired during Obama's first term because the signals were already very strong that Republicans were launching an all out assault to preserve a permanent system of white minority rule. For me, the rights and lives of hundreds of millions of people matter far more than what one wealthy and powerful person &quot;wants&quot;, even if she faced immense challenges to get to that point. Of course it shouldn't have ever reached that point in [pick your year/moment of crisis in the last decade], but it did.<br>
<br>
But I think one of the problems in any of us trying to analyze a decision like that from the outside is that the Supreme Court, with its limited number of lifetime appointments, is such a bizarre institution in a nominally democratic country. After all, I doubt many of us would have been close friends with Scalia.<br>
<br>
But that doesn't matter now. I just hope if the Democrats take back both the White House and the Senate, Breyer retires on day one of the new administration, Biden expands the court, and Democrats never again put all their hopes and dreams into the health of one person.

Yes, these fault lines around race and gender have always existed, but it's critical to note that the exploitation of them by both Americans (who form an actual secret group of evil people known as hyper-wealthy conservatives) and non-Americans (like Russians and whomever else) has been hyper-scaled by ad-driven social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.<br>

This piece is incredible, especially this part:
<blockquote>In the previous weeks and months I had begun to wonder whether my profession, for all its insistence on the value of facts, was not in the last instance dependent on dishonesty. If I pretended to care about the boy’s discovery of parkour and death metal, it was because I hoped that my kindness would lull him into feeling comfortable enough to tell me about the most painful moments of his life. I had told him and his guardian that I intended to write an article based on our conversations, but my disclosure, though accurate in a strict sense, obscured the nature of my intentions. What I should have said was that I intended to repackage the boy’s trauma into a digestible narrative I hoped would capture the attention of some hundred thousand internet users, who would then surrender valuable information about themselves to one or another technology baron, who would then reward the website for which I worked with a better starting position in the algorithmic rat race, which would allow the website’s owners to convince a handful of investors to keep funding the company, which in turn would allow my editors to pay me a salary, earn me accolades, and, eventually, if all went well, convince the US government that I deserved to live and work in this country. The boy was for me not an end but a means, and lately thoughts of that nature had been bothering me often enough that I wondered whether I shouldn’t do something else with my life.</blockquote>

<em>the wikipedia article on afghan refugees gives a better picture including the interesting fact that 5 million refugees came back after the US invasion</em><br>
<br>
I am starting to feel like a broken record. Returnees for each of these conflicts are mentioned in the report. They note 7.4 million returnees for the Afghanistan war.<br>
<br>
But that does not mean things are magically okay:
<blockquote>Even in the best circumstances of return, going home does not erase the experience of fleeing for one’s life or the struggle to survive after being displaced. The experiences of wartime displacement are profound, traumatic, and long-lasting. Returning home should not be equated with a return to normal or to a prior state of being. Displacement tends to transform and remake entire social worlds for the displaced, impoverishing people in the process.80 Some of course never return home either because they resettle elsewhere or because they die as refugees or IDPs.</blockquote>

<em>come to think of it, weren't the russians the ones who started the major civil war in afghanistan?<br>
<br>
doesn't sectarian conflict in the middle east account for many of its refugees? - and that's been going on for over 1000 years</em><br>
<br>
The white supremacy and ahistoricity in both this comment and the much longer, seemingly more thoughtful one above it just-asking-questions-about-assigning-blame are both breathtaking, but I appreciate that multiple comments have provided such profound evidence that Metafilter isn't immune to imperialist, white supremacist apologia.<br>

Except in this case, World War II had 30 to 64 million refugees+IDPs based on a war involving multiple superpowers, concentration camps, mass bombings, and atomic weapons.<br>

In comparison, the estimates for America's bipartisan war on terror is 37 to 59 million refugees and internally displaced people.<br>

In my experience, Americans living so breezily in the bubble of empire don't seem to take the atrocities committed in their name anywhere nearly as seriously as they understand World War II. It seems to be the same case here as well.<br>

<em>I continue to find it strange that some seem to talk as if MeFi is some hotbed of support for imperialist wars, much less the way in which those wars have been prosecuted.</em><br>
<br>
You will find plenty of reluctant and not-so-reluctant apologia here because the partisanship for both liberals and conservatives is so high that liberals will defend and excuse Obama's drone strikes at the same time as conservatives criticize him for them (and as Trump expands the program to all new heights of atrocity). That is so incredibly <em>weird</em> to me.<br>
<br>
After all, how big were the protests when Obama took over the Great American Bipartisan War Machine? How many were attended by the same people who went to the streets against Bush? <br>
<br>
The only winners in all of this are defense contractors. The losers, in every administration, are the people of color facing the asymmetrical, terrible might of an empire rotting from the inside out.<br>
<br>
Until Americans, even the woke ones who claim they believe Black Lives Matter, truly reckon with this contradiction, it will keep happening and it will only get worse. Whistleblowers and journalists, even the most odious ones, play an essential role in exposing these contradictions.

<em>I mean, y’all get why bringing up people such as Clarence Thomas is a distraction and talking about this in bad faith, no? It’s like if we were saying “listen to women” and someone brought up Sarah Huckabee. Like no shit, turns out that you should bring discernment along.</em> <br>
<br>
In my experience navigating a white world as melanated as I am, the discernment you speak of is not there in these spaces. I brought up Clarence Thomas as an extreme, but the Black and brown misleadership class is even more strongly represented in the liberal and leftist politics that I so often find myself in.<br>
<br>
This may not be your experience and that makes me glad! However, it is my experience and the experiences of similarly situated comrades in these spaces.<br>
<br>
Maybe things would be different if I were light skinned or passing, but that's not what I get. Instead, what I get is essentialization, tokenization, and fetishization. For me, it seems like identity-based valuation will only encourage more grifters and worse discourse.

<em>I can't help but feel some sympathy for this view, but I'm also a bit heartbroken because it's extraordinarily parochial. There's really little difference between &quot;the parties are the same to me because I'm only affected by their foreign policy&quot; and &quot;the parties are the same to me because I'm only affected by their copper refinery tax rates&quot;. There are millions of people who are desperately affected by the differences between these presidents.</em><br>
<br>
There is a depressing irony in calling the focus on &quot;foreign&quot; policy as &quot;extraordinarily parochial&quot;. You speak of millions of people affected by the differences between these presidents, but there are hundreds of millions of people affected by the similarity between these administrations.<br>
<br>
The difference is that the latter group is comprised up wholly of poor people of color who are essentially invisible on Metafilter and Western news media.<br>
<br>
The biggest difference for Americans is that Trump finally brought home just a fragment of the horrors that Americans have been dishing out abroad for decades (and what is on display in Collateral Murder). This fixation with Assange indicates to me that Americans have learned little from the decades of building massive charnel houses across the world.

The brunt of this will be borne by light skinned/white-passing people of color who are already often living in a liminal space in terms of their identity.

A world with universal healthcare and housing *and* prisons is still a world with prisons.<br>

<blockquote>If a white man wants to lynch me, that's his problem. If he's got the power to lynch me, that's my problem. Racism is not a question of attitude; it's a question of power. Racism gets its power from capitalism. Thus, if you're anti-racist, whether you know it or not, you must be anti-capitalist. The power for racism, the power for sexism, comes from capitalism, not an attitude.</blockquote>

There is so much transformative power in Carmichael's above analysis and it is telling (and depressing) how just little of that same Black radical tradition lives on in the writing and frameworks of the very well-off anti-racist writers reviewed here.<br>
<br>
It seems the <a href="https://www.blackagendareport.com/validity-and-usefulness-term-black-misleadership-class">Black Misleadership class</a> has its next generation of intellectuals who have successfully set an agenda that centers the perpetuation of their own already-established success and comfort at the expense of everyone else.<br>
<br>
DiAngelo, in her own words, demonstrates the limitations of liberal antiracism: &quot;white progressives cause the most daily damage to people of color&quot;. The other authors in this review may not explicitly claim this, but as a result of their careers, class position, and how capitalism centers the voices of the well-off, well-to-do white progressives are ultimately the white people they spend the most time around. Fannie Lou Hamer these folks are not.<br>
<br>
As a result of how white supremacy and capitalism have structured the lives and worlds of white progressives, who are generally more well off than their reactionary counterparts, rarely come into contact with people of color, unless those people of color also inhabit a similar class position. For example, something tells me the people of color that white Mefites are most close to aren't poor Yemenis terrified of bipartisan drone strikes/cluster bombs or poor homeless people of color in LA's Skid Row terrified of bipartisan policing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Radical relativity&quot; is not at all radical if it just means treating your friends of color better. As someone who is that friend of color for a whole lot of white people, it's certainly appreciated! But liberals have not convinced me that it won't just settle into a new form of liberal triumphalism and complacency.

<blockquote>“This is the first legislation we have seen that takes aim at the tremendous economic problems that already exist in the coalfields of America,” United Mine Workers of America International President Cecil E. Roberts said. “Coal-producing areas of our nation have taken a pounding, and it is not getting any better. Senator Duckworth’s bill is comprehensive and includes several programs and initiatives that would have strong, positive impacts on economically depressed communities in the coalfields, as well as dislocated workers and their families.”<br>
<br>
“We have a responsibility to ensure that the mine workers, who powered our industrial rise, built the arsenal of democracy, and fueled America’s economic prosperity, have good-paying jobs and work reclaiming abandoned mines, restoring wildlife habitat, reducing pollution, and revitalizing coal communities,” said Collin O’Mara, president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation. “Senator Duckworth’s Marshall Plan for Coal Country Act of 2020 keeps faith with these ideas and underscores that we can create hundreds of thousands of jobs reclaiming abandoned mine lands, sequestering carbon through nature and technology, restoring wildlife habitat, and rejuvenating coal communities. The Senate should swiftly take up this commonsense bill and ensure mining communities play a critical role in our efforts to rebuild our economy and act on climate.”</blockquote>

<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/159017/bidens-setting-get-blamed-lost-blue-collar-jobs">The third problem is that when it comes to coal and oil, liberals are doing conservatives' jobs for them</a>:
<blockquote>Democrats’ ambivalence toward the industry, in addition to being fatal to serious climate efforts, sidesteps a conversation that’s now unavoidable in parts of the country they should be trying to win. Texas alone lost 39,000 direct oil and gas jobs in the first half of 2020. Oilfield services companies—having laid off some 100,000 people amid the pandemic downturn—are now employing fewer people than they have since before the shale boom began, which could decimate local and state tax revenues. Appalachian shale bankruptcies were climbing even before the pandemic, to say nothing of the region’s decade-long nosedive in coal. And now Louisiana, Oklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico are all facing major fossil fuel job losses. Industry experts don’t predict an easy recovery, a view bolstered by major multinational oil companies selling off their investments in the unconventional high-cost drilling that fueled the last decade’s boom.<br>
<br>
Establishment Democrats, but also relative progressives championing a so-called just transition, continue to treat the fossil fuel industry as a reliable source of well-paid union work instead of a rapidly sinking ship. As a result, they’re mostly unprepared to rescue its passengers. The Biden climate platform allows for decades of continued fossil fuel extraction; it doesn’t seem to have a plan for supporting the millions of people whose livelihoods are threatened by the industry’s collapse—a phenomenon only tangentially related to climate measures.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Over the last few years, the Republicans have had a strange run when it comes to styling themselves as champions of the working class. As journalist Christian Parenti has written in 2016, Trump’s particular manner of speaking contained just enough pro-worker flourishes that some listeners disillusioned with Washington elbow-rubbing and a declining standard of living could plausibly backfill a populist agenda into his speeches. Back then, Trump had pledged to safeguard Social Security and Medicare, end costly wars, lower drug prices, and reinvigorate American manufacturing, all measures that more than a few members of the Democratic elite had neglected for years. “Trump took the Bernie-style populism, emptied it of real class politics, reduced it to a jumble of affective associations, and used it to beat-up the smug liberals of the professional managerial class,” Parenti wrote. “It worked.”<br>
<br>
With some help, of course, from the (decidedly non-populist) electoral college, it worked well enough to win an election. But four years later, with the country in deeper economic straits than it was even after the Great Recession, the Republican Party’s pitch to workers is thinner than ever. During his first term, Trump passed massive tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy while assembling a fiercely anti-worker National Labor Relations Board and working to slash the social safety net. More recently, he’s advocated a new payroll tax-deferral plan that would undermine the same Social Security program he once pledged to protect. The Republicans’ bizarre convention lineup—wealthy politicians, mansion-owners, and Trump family members—only further evince the fact that American right-wing populism is completely devoid of any actual legislation that might help workers.</blockquote>

<em>I want that to be true but the Southern Strategy has consistently shown that half of America is willing to vote themselves poor/sick/under the thumb of authoritarians if it means a black person gets fucked harder.</em><br>
<br>
Yes, there are some white people who are so tied to white supremacy they will always vote against their self-interests. There are also some poor people and people of color who are so tied to performative celebrations of identity politics they will always vote against their self-interests.<br>
<br>
But there are a lot more people of all races who straight up don't vote because no one has ever demonstrated to them that doing so will actually make their lives materially better. Of course, it doesn't help that voting is an extremely high friction process for many Americans, especially the younger and poorer you are.<br>
<br>
The Southern Strategy is over fifty years old now. Nothing about it should be a surprise. It is strange to me when people bring this up to me, a person of color, to explain that some white people are really racist. I am deeply aware :)<br>
<br>
What is the alternative otherwise? People of color and poor people live in red states too, often dealing with the worst levels of deprivation as a result, and I refuse to write them off.

With Trump (falsely) running on a bullshit isolationist foreign policy platform in 2016 and (bad faith) attacking Hillary Clinton for her Iraq war vote, it is clear the old saws about being strong on defense don't ring true anymore. Your example of Max Clelland is from <em>17 years ago</em>, ironically as long as the Iraq war has been raging on.<br>
<br>
My thesis is that neoconservatives have spent nearly a half century deeply parasitized to both parties, draining trillions of dollars into pointless forever wars, impoverishing and effectively disenfranchising countless tens of millions of Americans as a result of that forced austerity, killing millions of people of color abroad, and ultimately, none of this has actually brought Democrats material gains in terms of power.<br>
<br>
Just like &quot;tough on crime&quot;, &quot;tough on forever wars&quot; is no longer a winning tactic for Democrats.<br>
<br>
Following that, during an unprecedented pandemic and financial downturn, the voters Democrats need to win don't actually care about the intricacies of a disposition matrix or how effectively a cruise missile can level a Yemeni village. Just like the red state voters that Democrats are trying to win, these voters care about healthcare and jobs.<br>
<br>
Effective leadership, powered by mass movements that bundle Black Lives Matter with the Green New Deal and Medicare 4 All, can move the needle here on anti-imperialism by showing Americans what they materially lose when trillions of dollars that could have gone to healthcare, good jobs, and education instead go to fighting pointless forever wars that just end up creating more terrorists who have every valid reason to hate America.

<em>&quot;doesn't resonate with&quot; is definitely a very nice way to say &quot;offends the white racists&quot;. I mean, I agree with basically everything you wrote I just think we shouldn't undersell the racism or make excuses for those folks.</em><br>
<br>
There are plenty of poor/working class straight people of color of all races who are turned off by the centering of LGBT issues and even immigration issues. Hell, there are plenty of poor LGBTQ people of color who care a lot more about universal healthcare and housing than they do if the tough on crime prosecutor of color in their blue city get their pronouns right as her cops harass and brutalize them. These are all important groups for Democrats to materially engage with, not just some racist white people.<br>
<br>
In my experience, it is often easier to organize them, despite their biases, because they feel a greater urgency around healthcare and jobs than wealthier people who may be to the left of them culturally but have the privilege to worry more about what redistribution takes away from them instead of what it gives them.<br>
<br>
Besides, racism is not a terminal diagnosis. I believe poor/working class moderates and unengageds, just like liberals currently apologizing for white supremacist foreign policy, can overcome their prejudices.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, what hope is there for the marginalized?

<a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/24/21395668/wisconsin-elections-senate-tammy-baldwin">Democrats should learn the wisdom of Tammy Baldwin - Senate candidates in red states hold the future in their hands</a>:
<blockquote>California Sen. Kamala Harris, the vice presidential nominee who is clearly being positioned as the future of the party, situated herself in the tradition of “women like Mary Church Terrell and Mary McCleod Bethune, Fannie Lou Hamer and Diane Nash, Constance Baker Motley and Shirley Chisholm” while further name-checking her mother, who “raised us to be proud, strong Black women. And she raised us to know and be proud of our Indian heritage.”<br>
<br>
Red-state Democrats don’t talk like this — a contrast that’s about political style and points of rhetorical emphasis, rather than policy. To pick up marginal voters who are typically white and not college-educated, they zero in relentlessly on the idea that they are bringing concrete, material assistance to people in need rather than their candidacy being an avatar of cultural or demographic change.</blockquote>

It is interesting how this intersects with leftist ideas of organizing that focuses on material redistributive efforts on things like health care and jobs instead of rhetoric around identity politics/demographic diversity. This very much mirrors my experiences of organizing with moderates/conservatives/politically unengaged people: sure, they were ignorant about all my marginalized identities, but I could turn them into solid allies if I focused on healthcare and jobs.<br>
<br>
In strong blue locales like the Bronx, it is an asset to have candidates like AOC deftly wield both in synthesis and engage young people who are the future of the party, but the identity part doesn't resonate with the poor/working class moderates in red states that Democrats need to flip the Senate in this next election.<br>
<br>
In this way, however unfair it is, Biden being an affable, old white straight man ends up being an asset, but only if he is able to thread the needle of appearing moderate while still campaigning on ultimately radical ideas around healthcare, jobs, and education (and not having elite donors ratfuck us all into ecological collapse).

<a href="https://zora.medium.com/kamalas-complicated-relationship-with-the-south-asian-community-d1f54d79bd58">Kamala’s Complicated Relationship With the South Asian Community</a>:
<blockquote>“Kamala’s 2017 tweet welcoming Modi was a very stark moment for us in understanding that she might be somebody who is in favor of the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) ruling government in India, which is so frightening because we know the human rights abuses that are happening under the BJP government in India right now,” says Hossain. “The ruling party of India is setting up the largest detention camps for the world for Muslims, they are actively denaturalizing Dalits, Adivasi, and Muslim communities under programs like the National Registry of Citizens and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). She invokes India when it is convenient.”<br>
<br>
So when Harris started talking idlis and dosas in the days before her struggling presidential campaign was suspended, then explained how she was raised, “to know and be proud of [her] Indian heritage,” during her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention (DNC), many of us wondered whose benefit those statements were for.</blockquote>

So many things I'd like to excerpt from this article, but the one that has gotten the least attention is what sort of relationship Harris, someone who is descended from Brahmins, will have with the largest fascist government in the history of our world, especially as that government plainly commits mass violence against Muslims and Dalits.

<blockquote>All of this should be preceded by an attitudinal shift: Progressives should be through waiting and begging to be taken seriously by the Democratic Party. It’s not terribly relevant, in the present, whether the party might be made more progressive as a demographic inevitability or through left’s strategizing. It isn’t where it ought to be now. And the only thing that might move Democratic legislators in the near term is a progressive resolve to wear them down into submission. That’s it. If the left can generate noise and anxiety far in excess of its size in the electorate—as they managed to in the 1960s in the movements for Civil Rights and against the Vietnam War—the country will have a shot at change. The country may well be doomed. But we won’t have a fighting chance if we don’t start planning the fight.</blockquote>

<em>Also, it also bothers me that we keep seeing supposedly &quot;leftist&quot; candidates getting outed as misogynistic.

<br>
This has little to do with leftist politics and it is interesting that you are framing it this way. Biden and Bill Clinton are not leftists in any way and their horrifyingly misogynistic and racist actions as actual adults with immense amounts of power have never been reckoned with. One got invited to speak at the DNC and the other was elected by the majority of Democrats across the country to run for <em>president</em>. If Coleman is to be faulted for how he is approaching this, then I would point to who his role models for evading accountability are.<br>
<br>
I don't think Coleman shoud be running for office at this point. He needs therapy and there must be restorative justice and community accountability. But it is misleading to omit that he was 12 years old in the initial post or to frame this as something related to leftist politics.

One of the problems facing American liberals/&quot;leftys&quot; trying to convince leftists about what to do and how to think about this election is that these are two <strong>very</strong> different schools of thought and ideology, with less shared language and ideals than liberals have with conservatives. Consider how Biden has an easier time courting moderate Republicans than leftists even with such a relatively radical platform.<br>
<br>
When there are such fundamental disagreements on the most basic of material historical and future conditions, it is going to be very difficult to build the rapport and credibility to convince leftists. Compounding this is the fact that most leftists, like myself, started out <em>as liberals</em> and only ended up where we are today as a result of being let down so much and so thoroughly over decades of participation in liberal politics. The collision of the 2008 financial crisis, GOP intransigence, and Obama's own moderate, donor-driven politics have ironically radicalized at least two generations of young people far to the left. Silver linings indeed.<br>
<br>
This mismatch seems to play a significant role in why overtures from the center to the left fall so flat and why these conversations are so frustrating for everyone involved.<br>
<br>
That said, I think Andrew Yang, of all people!, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/8/20/21394924/dnc-joe-biden-andrew-yang-magic">has done a better job than anyone else I have seen so far</a>:

My fear is that if Biden wins, liberals will revert back to the brunchy triumphalism they have always gone back to when their side wins elections.

<blockquote>Parliamentary war games, the fanaticism of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the dire threat of a radical Supreme Court—these are not quite the stuff of a stump speech, let alone a party convention where the guiding idea is to rally voters behind an optimistic vision. But after three days of speeches, we know with precision what Joe Biden wants: a big tent to contain the Sanders wing of the Democratic Party and the Kasich wing of the Republican Party. In return, Republicans get a decent man and Democrats get progressive policy. Everybody gets no more Donald Trump. But these desires of Biden have been evident since the outset of his campaign. The piece that’s always been missing, and which will likely go unfound by the time the convention concludes on Thursday night with whatever Democrats come up with as its virtual version of a balloon drop, is the reckoning with reality and the plan for action. “We’ve got to do the work,” said Kamala Harris on Wednesday night. As some point, it may become necessary to explain how this work will work.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It’s not that many people will just forget Harris’s long career in law enforcement. In pursuit of the nomination, Bloomberg News described the potentially advantageous shifts in her public persona in the wake of national uprisings against police killings. “The reform debate burnishes the former San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general as a social-justice activist. It also protects the Biden campaign from potential criticism of her efforts while in those jobs to slow innocence bids and punish parents whose children were truants, among other contentious actions.”<br>
<br>
Maybe that’s the Harris she meant to evoke in her acceptance speech. “We’ve gotta do the work to fulfill that promise of equal justice under law,” she said, “because none of us are free … until all of us are free.” While she spoke, her home state was burning—more than 300 fires reported in 72 hours, Governor Gavin Newsom said Wednesday. Yet the state still faces a critical shortage of firefighters, The Sacramento Bee was reporting. People incarcerated in California’s prisons are the state’s primary “hand crews,” sent out to cut firelines with hand tools and chainsaws in locations where bulldozers can’t reach. (They are paid a pittance—$1.45 an hour, according to the ACLU.) Now, as prisons allowed Covid-19 to spread unchecked, some prisoners are too sick for wildfire duty and others have been released to help slow transmission. The shortage was something Harris had seen coming as attorney general. In 2014, facing a court order to release prisoners from conditions ruled unconstitutional, the state fought back. Lawyers representing her office argued that if prisoners were to be released early to comply with the order, the available prison labor pool would dwindle.</blockquote>

Yes, I am advocating this. They have all contributed to crimes against humanity, particularly to millions of people of color. Furthermore, the complete abandonment of fighting climate change under the guise of liberal incrementalism will lead to suffering for billions of people of color.<br>

I know it won't happen right now because America is a deeply white supremacist country, as your post and many posts here so strongly indicate.

Where did I say they should be dragged to the Hague while Trump and his administraton is still in office? I imagine there is a bulk discount if we ship them off all together at the same time, along with Henry Kissinger, the Clinton administration, and both Bush administrations.

They can't be 100% of the time correct on 100% of issues that 100% of the base will agree with.</em><br>
<br>
Yes, I agree elected Democrats are doing what they think is right. But what they &quot;ultimately think is right&quot; also aligns neatly with the interests of health insurance companies, the finance sector, and defense manufacturers that systematically devalue and treat as expendable the lives of poor people and people of color. This deprivation was already at <strong>billions</strong> of years of life stolen and lost during the Obama years, primarily from poor people of color.<br>
<br>
I look forward to ousting them as you said and dragging them to the Hague for crimes against humanity. But that only happens with leverage. And the time during a primary along with right before an election is the moment where the marginalized have the most leverage. Staying meek and quiet is not an option for those who lack the privilege to think the status quo before Trump was at all good in any way.

<em>Do you want the philosophical victory or the power to make the change? Because there's millions out there that will be starving but can't survive on philosophical victory, delicious as it may be.</em><br>
<br>
It is confusing to claim to be &quot;on the left&quot; or talk about &quot;us on the left&quot; and then minimize the <em>millions already starving</em> as a result of the white supremacist policies enacted by the administration Biden spent 8 years in and is staking his entire campaign on. Do Yemeni and Iraqi lives not matter because they can't cast votes in American elections?<br>
<br>
I appreciate Justinian's honesty on this. I understand a position of &quot;I think these policies are atrocious, but I don't think this will move votes against someone who is going to so much worse than Biden and will permanently close the door for anything better in the future&quot;. I actually agree with that! But I also don't think Biden coming out against drone strikes will make a difference either because most Americans right now care about jobs and healthcare.<br>
<br>
For a lot of others here, I can't tell if they oppose these policies or if they are using electoral concerns as a cover for not having to actually articulate that they <em>prefer</em> these policies. That's some wild shit, but then again, as you have all mentioned multiple times, drone strikes are popular among Americans.

It's something moderate Republicans care more about than the genocidal war crimes he has committed or will continue to commit in his future administration. Biden’s white supremacist foreign policy legacy really only appeals to neoconservative hawks, who are going to vote for him anyway.

<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/158957/biden-harris-democrats-wall-street-ticket">The Democrats’ Eternal Wall Street Ticket</a>: The Biden-Harris nomination represents the party’s return to free-market fealty.
<blockquote>In the face of another four years of Trump, a Biden-Harris administration is probably our best chance for a workable recovery from the pandemic and the related recession. But whether or not a Biden-led recovery would do as much for the working class as it does for the rich is less certain. Biden, of course, oversaw the 2008 bank bailout as vice president and, while a Delaware senator, coddled the credit card industry. This election season, the campaign contributions he’s received from Wall Street surpass Trump’s, which doesn’t inspire much confidence for future crackdowns on corporate greed. In fact, he’s explicitly promised to avoid heavy-handed measures: “Corporate America has to change its ways,” Biden said at a July fundraiser hosted by financial executives but immediately added, “It’s not going to require legislation. I’m not proposing any.”</blockquote>

<br>
I wonder how liberal feminists would feel if Biden took a page from notable DNC speaker John Kaisich's book and shifted to a moderate position on abortion in order to bring in suburban Republicans. Would that still be a satisfying half loaf?<br>

<br>
There is a vast world of ideologies other than &quot;tankie&quot; that exist outside of the white supremacist bipartisan foreign policy consensus that Biden has so richly contributed to and is still aligned with. It is telling that &quot;being against white supremacist mass genocide&quot; is now a political position worthy of ridicule on here though.<br>
<br>
It seems like there is never a good time for leftists to speak up against white supremacy emanating from Democratic politicians. It can't be before the primary because then the fascists win. It can't be before the election because then the fascists win.

<blockquote>The closest analogy to app stores outside of the mobile world are PC games stores like Steam, GOG, Battle.net, and others. For a long time, Steam was the premier game store, running uncontested for years. But over the last decade, multiple publishers and game devs (including Epic) have stepped up to create their own digital storefronts, which eventually led Steam to lower its service fees. While some people may complain about things being annoying now that Steam is no longer the home for every single game, it’s a clear case of competition resulting in more revenue for game devs and lower prices for consumers.<br>
<br>
But perhaps the bigger issue is when Apple and Google’s own app store guidelines get applied in different degrees. According to emails shown to Congress during the recent tech antitrust hearing, Apple agreed to cut its typical 30% service fees in half for a year in order to entice Amazon to put Prime Video in the App Store.</blockquote>

<em>I vehemently disagree with this, even as an ardent lefty.

In actuality, we have the tools and technology, and regulatory and legal frameworks to address global heating right now.</em><br>
<br>
As an ardent leftist, I vehemently disagree with your conclusion :)<br>
<br>
Calling carbon trading &quot;the most effective action on climate change today&quot; in 2020 reveals everything about just how effective it actually is. Moderate steps that rely on the &quot;wisdom&quot; of the market, like carbon trading, may have been useful in stopping ecological collapse if we had started on them 40 years ago when the people in power knew what was coming, but it is far too late for that.<br>
<br>
Was it because the moderate actions weren't moderate enough? Or because the systems responsible for knowingly destroying the world had no interest in relinquishing even a basis point of profit and power?<br>
<br>
We have about 10 years to significantly decarbonize human civilization; as evidenced by last September's protests, that will not be possible with polite requests to the most powerful, entrenched interests in human history.<br>
<br>
I don't think anyone is saying militant revolution is not easier, but only that it is the only possible way to avoid activating the tipping points and feedback loops that will destroy our world.<br>
<br>
<em>Attempting to link the geopolitical manoeuvrings of Iran and Saudi Arabia in relation to Yemen as part of a climate change struggle is not realistic.

<em>So many people calling for revolutions, they have never lived through one. The history of revolutions is that they are generally pretty terrible to be in, whatever side you're on. Far from the only and definitely not the best way to achieve change.</em><br>

I have spent my entire life living under the three revolutions of carbon capitalism, neoliberalism, and imperialism and yes, they have been quite terrible to live through! But the revolutionary acts required to save our world from ecological collapse will be a lot less terrible than the reactionary revolution of a world with billions of climate refugees struggling to survive and dozens of major climate conflicts erupting across every part of the world.<br>

<br>
I don't think carceral liberals, of all people, should be advising leftists on strategy or even morality.<br>
<br>
It is a supremely bizarre ideology where the subjective, arguable perception of participating in &quot;the long history of white people trying to dictate how to protest to black protestors&quot; via a tweet has far more serious consequences attached to it than the objective, actual reality of actually killing and jailing innocent people of color and in some cases, participating in white supremacist genocides that have killed millions of people of color.<br>
<br>
Mass incarceration, the Iraq War, and the Yemen genocide are just a few white supremacist horrors perpetrated by people still glowingly celebrated and ardently defended on Metafilter. It is telling which long histories of victimization are cancel-worthy and which ones aren't. It is telling whose lives actually matter to carceral liberals.<br>
<br>
Moreover, should people on Metafilter lose their jobs for supporting the white supremacist actions of their favorite politicians? I have seen liberals on this site defend war crimes because it's being done by &quot;their side&quot;. There have been extension comments from myself and other people of color about the depressing amount of racism on this site. Should Mefites lose their jobs for their bigotry and fascism?<br>
<br>
<em>Not to mention that the idea of people asserting their their right of association to exclude bigots, abusers, and fascists is &quot;throwing people away&quot; has some rather problematic implications.</em><br>

You are confusing me with someone else because I am not talking about the right of association, but whether or not people should be deprived jobs, healthcare, housing, and other material needs because they aren't powerful/wealthy/popular enough to avoid cancellation (see above).<br>

If everyone has implicit and explicit biases when it comes to racism, then what triggers cancellation and deprivation? And why is it that the most ardent supporters of cancellation and deprivation always seem to move the goal posts just before their own biases? Hmm.

<blockquote>The Lincoln Project’s critics on the left are correct about the GOP. The Republican Party is a purely malignant force in American politics and American life. It has no positive contributions to make, its major policies are not supported by the majority of the American public, and it would not be as powerful or as radical as it is were it not for the advantages the design of the federal government grants to conservatives. Those advantages, left in place, will prevent Democrats from meaningfully addressing our most significant problems as a country and society, including an environmental crisis that threatens all civilization. Much of what ails us cannot be fixed without structurally disempowering the GOP as an institution—its incapacitation is the only plausible and morally defensible remedy to polarization and partisan gridlock we have. Many progressives now take all these things for granted. But the leaders of the Democratic Party, the political press, and most voters, including most Democratic voters, simply do not—even now, as over a hundred thousand Americans have been killed by the coronavirus thanks, in large part, to the arrogance and stupidity of Republican policymakers.<br>
<br>
If most non-Republicans remain insufficiently hostile towards the GOP as a whole in the post-Trump era, that will have much less to do with the Lincoln Project and the activities of particular NeverTrump Republicans now than the influence of generations of propaganda about how politics ought to work and the structural factors on which the Republican Party depends. None of that will be undone by tweets about how the Lincoln Project is a grift: At some point, progressives will need to take advantage of all we’ve seen pressure campaigns can do these past few weeks to convince Democratic leaders and ordinary voters to think as they do about Republicans and the implications of sharing power with them.</blockquote>

<em>It's just that there have traditionally been huge amounts of pressure on women who have been raped to forgive, or worse, marry their rapist which has been fully sanctioned by civil society. A certain part of accountability is both sides coming together in good faith and I don't doubt that certain people will hijack that in order to accept the minimal amount of accountability to get away with things. I don't see this as a deal breaker, mainly the restorative version of &quot;I'd rather 1,000 guilty people go free then one innocent person falsely seen as guilty&quot;.<br>
<br>
However, I'm not going to deny people who have had to deal with these circumstances since forever the ability to feel that carcereal methods might be valid and I don't think invalidating their feelings is a great thing to do and is just another flavor of *that* priest telling a raped young woman that Jesus has forgiven her rapist, why can't she?</em><br>
<br>
The carceral state already has countess perpetrators accept <strong>no accountability</strong>! The travesties of injustice we have seen with Jeffrey Epstein, Bill Cosby, Harvey Weinstein, and other serial predators all happened under a society at its most carceral, not because they were somehow shielded by a shadowy cabal of abolitionist women of color who just love protecting powerful abusers.<br>
<br>
In my years of working extensively with survivors of sexual violence, I consistently saw just how little the carceral state actually cared about victims. The inability of the carceral state to center the needs and wants of survivors (and importantly, prevent future violence) was a significant driver behind the rise of restorative justice and accountability over the past few decades.<br>
<br>
If you somehow think this is akin to priests telling victims to forgive their rapists, then I recommend you read through the information I have provided.

<em>I'm not a carceral feminist/liberal but I'm pretty sure women have watched perpetrators of violence against them and their gender time and time again not being held accountable by the non-carceral side of society and attempts to keep this violence non-carceral (simply by virtue of the perpetrator being straight, white, and male) has resulted in women being forced to accept non-accountability as &quot;justice&quot; against their will since time immemorial.</em><br>
<br>
Much of the work around community accountability and restorative justice come from women of color who specifically built these frameworks around issues of gender-based violence after seeing the massive amount of damage done by the union of white feminists and the carceral state.<br>
<br>
&quot;The non-carceral side of society&quot; is not the same thing as community accountability and restorative justice. This binary only exists if you accept carceral ideologies as the only way to structure our lives. <a href="https://incite-national.org/community-accountability/">There is a ton of reading if you are interested in this</a>.<br>
<br>
Carceral ideologies believe police, prisons, and throwing people away all play a critical and necessary role in our society even though all the evidence pointing out just how unhelpful all are to victims of violence and how they instead further propagate existing systemic injustices. The carceral mindset, like other belief systems, is not something you can simply self-identify out of by saying &quot;I'm not a carceral feminist/liberal&quot;.

<em>This is the thing that I think has a lot of relevance and that honestly I think about a lot. There’s a difference, I think, between deplatforming someone (getting them off twitter, YouTube, etc) and preventing them from being employed in even low-wage work, thus condemning them and their entire family to crippling poverty (and in an era of Covid, even potentially death) because of really most things they have done. If you are a prison abolitionist because no matter what folks have done it doesn’t justify them being brutalized, then similarly I think it’s important to focus on the violence that capitalism can inflict on people that damage or endanger it by harming “their brand”.<br>
<br>
Social stigma, to me, is a different thing than preventing people from putting food on their table. It would be different if we had a robust social safety net, but we don’t. Instead it runs the risk of making folks houseless and in danger of medical consequences in the greatest depression of our lives.</em><br>
<br>
Yes, I am completely aligned with this. But I think there are a lot of carceral feminists/liberals who cannot let go of their punitive worldview because the alternative is so much messier and difficult to actually think through.<br>
<br>
For example, if a cancel-worthy offense are so awful to lose one's job and be deprived of employee driven healthcare, private housing, and freedom from deprivation in this current dystopian world, does it mean those cancel-worthy offenses are also still so awful that the accused should also lose access to public healthcare, housing, and other public services in a future utopian world?<br>

I was going to post that article, PhineasGage! I really enjoyed it, especially this part:
<blockquote>Activists regularly challenge criticisms of “cancel culture” by saying: “Come on, we’re just some people with Twitter accounts, up against governments and corporate behemoths.” But when you look at the economic incentives, almost always, the capitalist imperative is to yield to activist pressure. Just a bit. Enough to get them off your back. Companies caught in the scorching light of a social-media outcry are like politicians caught lying or cheating, who promise a “judge-led inquiry”: They want to do something, anything, to appear as if they are taking the problem seriously—until the spotlight moves on.<br>
<br>
Some defenestrations are brilliant, and long overdue. Weinstein’s removal from a position of power was undoubtedly a good thing. But the firing of Emmanuel Cafferty was not. For activists, the danger lies in the cheap sugar rush of tokenistic cancellations. Real institutional change is hard; like politics, it is the “slow boring of hard boards.” Persuading a company to toss someone overboard for PR points risks a victory that is no victory at all. The pitchforks go down, but the corporate culture remains the same. The survivors sigh in relief. The institution goes on.<br>
<br>
If you care about progressive causes, then woke capitalism is not your friend. It is actively impeding the cause, siphoning off energy, and deluding us into thinking that change is happening faster and deeper than it really is. When people talk about the “excesses of the left”—a phenomenon that blights the electoral prospects of progressive parties by alienating swing voters—in many cases they’re talking about the jumpy overreactions of corporations that aren’t left-wing at all.</blockquote>

I personally think it's a great thing to let the polite white supremacist genocide perpetrators waste their time and energy fighting the rude white supremacist genocide perpetrators.<br>
<br>
But I think it would be horrifying if liberals actually think the polite white supremacist genocide perpetrators will stop being and doing those awful things after Trump.<br>
<br>
The leopards will continue eating people's faces whenever they have power; they just won't be as rude and unclassy about it.

<em>Provocative post and a subject I've been trying to carve time to truly dive into - among all the agonizing reappraisals white America seems to finally be flirting with - if protests and book sales and streaming #s are indication - this reality of the liberal left's (and I am one) literal daily living and voting priorities and how those have formed policies and practices to meet the ends have too often proved legitimately suspect. As Dylan proclaimed, &quot;it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard .... it's a hard rain a-gonna fall.&quot;</em><br>
<br>
Yes, I think the last few decades of liberal leadership (and sometimes even progressive leadership!) in all these blue cities has credibly demonstrated the dire limitations of what is possible for marginalized people under liberal politics.<br>
<br>
It has also clearly demonstrated the limitations of liberal politics and its pursuit to merely reform racial capitalism and subtly ameliorate the consequences of intergenerational material dispossession instead of forcefully and directly dismantling these horrors.

<em>Here's the thing - I reject this framing, because of it being based in the &quot;internet as separate from real life&quot; mentality that's been a large part of how we got here in the first place. Shor didn't &quot;say something horrible on the internet&quot;, he chose to engage in the time-dishonored tradition of admonishing black protestors for protesting the wrong way. Except that this time, the protesters finally had a voice (so they could tell Shor what they thought of his behavior), and clout (so that they could push back.)</em><br>
<br>
You aren't addressing my question that you are quoting.<br>
<br>
Moreover, there have been plenty of Metafilter users who have admonished Black protestors for protesting the wrong way over the years I have been here. I'm sure plenty of their parents and relatives also feel that way and have said similar things. Just this year I have seen Metafilter users defend war crimes against people of color and sexual assault due to the perpetrators being Democrats.<br>
<br>
Is job loss the consequence for these time-dishonored behaviors? In your experience as a person of color, how has Shor's firing made your life better?<br>
<br>
<em>(This is why the anti-carceral movement tends to fall on its face in matters of sexual harassment and assault.)</em><br>
<br>
Does it? Do you have any readings on this?<br>

There is a very vocal user segment of gamers who want more and more stunning production values in their AAA games, which require more and more money to produce, but don't want to pay more money for them either upfront or through microtransactions. They are also sick of sequels and instead want original IPs, which are a far riskier business proposition.<br>
<br>
If gamers want blockbusters, then they will have to deal with the inherent downsides of being a consumer of blockbuster content.<br>

<em>You're quite free to make such political arguments - but you have to accept the consequences of doing so.</em><br>
<br>
I think there are very different conversations happening in parallel here. There is the conversation debating what and why Shor/Cafferty did (and whether it was bad) along with whatever wealthy white liberal drama Mounk is or isn't involved in.<br>
<br>
The thing I am far more interested in is whether or not the consequences they face are appropriate and if they even help fight white supremacy. This is independent of whether or not they actually did the bad thing.<br>
<br>
After all, I can think of at least one incredibly appalling statement on this very comment thread that is far more inflammatory than anything Shor said or Cafferty did, at least to tens of millions of people of all races in America. I can think of much worse things white people and people of color on this very site have said to me over the years that carry far more malice and pain than what Shor said or Cafferty did.<br>
<br>
Should these users &quot;accept the consequence&quot; of losing their job and facing a deluge of social media harassment because of one horrible thing they said on the internet?<br>
<br>
That doesn't sound like liberation to me. Even if they said it out of spite or cruel mockery, this consequence is not something I wish on them or anyone else on here or other spaces. But it seems like I am in the minority here (pun intended).<br>
<br>
The primacy of punishment and deterrence as a form of social control is a foundational element in all carceral ideologies, including the carceral feminism and anti-racism so vocally represented in this space. On the other hand, the principles and frameworks of restorative justice and community accountability decenter binaries of punishment and deterrence to focus instead on the much harder work of community healing and self-determination.<br>
<br>
To dismiss this as &quot;well <em>technically</em> these mobs are not the government right now and these are just a few anecdotes&quot; is to ignore that this, <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2019/08/gamergate-video-games-five-years-later.html">just like what eventually came out from the hell that was GamerGate</a>, is only the beginning. I would much rather talk about the hard work now than wait until later when it becomes so much more difficult to do so.

<em>I for one rejoice at these white folks getting fired, and if they were totally and utterly innocent, even better!</em> <br>
<br>
I missed this initially but a world of &quot;negative reparations&quot;, where the goal is for dominant groups to begin living as miserably as minority groups, seems bizarre and profoundly undesirable to me.<br>
<br>
&quot;A better world is not possible for the oppressed, so we just have to strive to make the oppressors start to feel as badly as we have for untold centuries.&quot;<br>
<br>
Liberals have both spent decades trying to change individual behavior through fear and deterrence as opposed to solidarity against unjust systems. How well has this framework worked for securing material progress for people of color?

<em>With all due respect, I don't think there's any comparison between outraged social media mobs, and police who literally kill with impunity.</em><br>
<br>
Job loss, particularly for working class people of color like Cafferty, is a form of violence. It is the primary form of social control under white supremacist capitalism.<br>
<br>
And job loss through imprisonment is the dominant form of violence inflicted by the police. It is a significant driver of racial disparities in public health in America.<br>
<br>
I am far less likely to get shot by a cop who wants to fuck my shit up than to lose my job due to a bogus charge that lands me in jail (mostly because of the difference in paperwork and scrutiny).<br>
<br>
Cops kill about a thousand people a year. They imprison and dispossess millions more.<br>
<br>
If this form of economic violence is deemed okay by carceral feminists on Metafilter, as repeated multiple times above, but the issue is that it is the cops doing it and not social media mobs, then the comparison seems entirely fair.

As for another anecdote, <a href="https://www.theroot.com/christian-cooper-says-he-will-not-participate-in-prosec-1844311040">this time about an actual racist white woman who tried to get a Black man killed by the cops</a>:
<blockquote>On one end of the spectrum are police and prison abolitionists, for whom defunding the police is just one step toward a complete dismantling and reimagining of the criminal justice system as we know it. Among them is Josie Duffy Rice, president of the criminal justice-centered website, The Appeal, who pointed out that Amy Cooper had already suffered consequences for her actions.<br>
<br>
“Charging her is the easy solution. It’s the easy way out. And it reinforces the idea that justice can only be found in the disastrous carceral system we’ve created,” Rice wrote in a viral tweet on Monday.<br>
<br>
To abolitionists like Rice, Angela Davis and Derecka Purnell, a human rights lawyer who recently wrote about her journey toward police abolition in The Atlantic, there is no police reform possible when the very foundations of policing were to suppress and oppress enslaved people, as well as immigrants and labor organizers. But more importantly, focusing on punitive measures takes billions of dollars of resources—time, energy, manpower and funding—from tackling the root causes of crime, like poverty or a lack of safe and affordable housing (Christian Cooper tread a bit of this ground when he questioned the efficacy of legal punishment in deterring people like Amy Cooper from committing similar acts).</blockquote>

When I initially watched the video of what happened, my first thought was &quot;fuck, that could have been me&quot;. This is why I cross the street when I see a white woman or a white couple in certain parts of every city I have ever lived in. It is why I change how I walk and take up space in the world when I am out in public.<br>
<br>
But I have to agree with Rice, Angela Davis, and Cooper himself: if this exact same situation had happened to me, I would not cooperate with the police or the prosecutor because they are not here to help me. It is the same reason why I don't trust social media outrage: what is the point of fighting for police and prison abolition if those mechanisms are just handed over to another unaccountable group that tends to prey on the already vulnerable and dispossessed?

<em>I don't talk anecdotes in The Atlantic at face value, sorry, because I don't believe them to be dealing with me in good faith. I think it is naïve and dangerous to think anything in that publication is in the service of anything besides glory for the author and editor. I have been avoiding saying that because in my experience people react poorly to having their sources' trustworthiness questioned. But that is the case: I read the article and frankly do not think I can act as if the presentation of Cafferty's story was in the service of truth-telling. So I at least really am disinclined to focus on the specifics here because I think the specifics were arranged beforehand by bad actors.</em><br>
<br>
That's certainly your prerogative. But there is a lot of daylight between &quot;not trusting the publication or the author&quot; and &quot;not reading the piece&quot;.<br>
<br>
I find Cafferty's story interesting because of the specifics, <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/sdge-worker-fired-over-alleged-racist-gesture-says-he-was-cracking-knuckles/2347414/">namely that his accuser backtracked after he got fired</a>:
<blockquote>NBC 7 spoke to the man who originally posted the picture on Twitter. He has since deleted his account and said he may have gotten &quot;spun up&quot; about the interaction and misinterpreted it. He says he never intended for Cafferty to lose his job.</blockquote>

<br>
Have you read the article? Because Cafferty, a working-class person of color, does not fit your characterization:
<blockquote>After finishing high school, Cafferty bounced from one physically demanding and poorly paid job to another. For most of his life, he had trouble making ends meet. But his new job was set to change all that. “I was very proud of my position,” Cafferty told me. “It was the first time in my life where I wasn’t living check to check.”</blockquote>

The current punitive deterrence dynamic is what Lee Atwater describes in <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/exclusive-lee-atwaters-infamous-1981-interview-southern-strategy/">his explanation of the Southern Strategy</a>. Looking at the markers of quality of life for people of color in the past decade where this dynamic has commoditized itself into an entire industry of crisis management consultants and diversity seminars, it is clear that punitive deterrence has not actually secured material progress for people of color.<br>
<br>
The absence of explicit or even implicit racism by individuals is not the presence of systemic racial justice.<br>
<br>

<em>There is a desire for evidence that Black activists are the real villains, and thus some will be provided, even if you have to force a story that doesn't quite fit into that box. The contradictions and inconvenient details will be ignored so that the narrative continues to work.</em><br>
<br>
Please point out where I have said that (or where you found that in the article).<br>
<br>
I have been an anti-racist organizer my entire life and I am deeply serious in trying to understand what consequences should exist for non-famous/non-wealthy/non-powerful people being outed as doing something racist, even when it turns out they didn't do anything racist. Hell, I am deeply interested in the situations when that sort of person is actually racist. What do we do then?<br>
<br>
<em>I think it’s good that people are finally starting to lose their jobs over being racist.</em><br>
<br>
Could you tell me more why you think that's a good thing?<br>
<br>
Job loss makes absolute sense for racist police officers or CEOs or politicians. But for someone who doesn't have that kind of power and wealth, I do not think the current model of &quot;3 days of nonstop abusive social media harassment + job loss&quot; actually does anything valuable in the fight against white supremacy.<br>
<br>
For the other few people of color on Metafilter who disagree, I would love to hear how situations of people of color being falsely accused of racism and losing their jobs have improved your life.<br>
<br>
I think anyone who actually thinks the current punitive regime is working not taking the question seriously or is demonstrating just how difficult it is to let go of a carceral mindset that thinks throwing away people is equivalent to deterrence. It is easy to say &quot;defund the police, abolish prisons, and racism bad&quot;, but far harder to grapple with what restorative justice and community accountability look like.

<br>
I don't see an implication that the best response is to scale back on calling out racism because I don't see social media mobs going after employers to fire random workers and sending the workers harassing messages as &quot;calling out racism&quot;.<br>
<br>
From the article:
<blockquote>The loss of his job has left Cafferty shaken. A few days ago, he spoke with a mental-health counselor for the first time in his life. “A man can learn from making a mistake,” he told me. “But what am I supposed to learn from this? It’s like I was struck by lightning.”</blockquote>

I think Mounk overreaches at the end about these injustices provoking a political backlash. Racists will certainly use these tragic edge cases to support their bigotry, but I think this backlash effect is overstated.<br>
<br>
As a person of color who has been personally affected by anti-Black and anti-Brown racism from the police and regular ol' white folks, I find these injustices horrifying in their own sad way. I wonder if social media mobs are so because firing random people fired at least feels like some sort of accomplishment while Henry Kissinger and the police who have killed countless Black people happily walk free.

<em>genuinely confused by this -- it's the exact same usage as &quot;Europeans&quot; and &quot;Americans&quot; in that sentence -- a fairly standard thing for many country adjectives to turn into nouns.</em><br>
<br>
Unlike &quot;Americans&quot; or &quot;Europeans&quot;, &quot;Indian&quot; and &quot;Chinese&quot; aren't just country adjectives though. They also describe the racial identities of millions of people who live outside of those countries.<br>
<br>

Like with most social science things, it's likely going to be a mixture of the inherent cruelty needed to rise to the top of the capitalist hell machine (as Your Childhood Pet Rock points out), along with the corrosive exposure to the hell machine itself (which this article summarizes).<br>
<br>
The research into altruism is incredibly interesting, especially the finding that rich people can be generous when in an environment with low inequality. This does not bode well for our current state of rampant inequality, which seems to indicate a feedback loop of cruelty and hoarding.

<br>
I think it's a beautiful one. The critical difference between &quot;people of color&quot; and &quot;colored people&quot; is that the latter is something that is done to us, implicitly by whiteness. The former centers us as people who also happen to be united in solidarity against white supremacy.<br>

<em>Oh man that last link is interesting. It says that BIPOC stands for Black, Indigenous AND People of Color. The first time I came across the term, I was told it stood for Black AND Indigenous People of Color.</em><br>
<br>
Yeah, this is one of the problems with BIPOC as a term. There seem to be two <em>very</em> different meanings for it, and it isn't immediately clear which one people mean in conversation.<br>
<br>
For me, &quot;people of color&quot; is a very useful term in terms of broadly discussing all the different identities who struggle against white supremacy. But beyond that, I think it is far more useful to specify and name which groups people want to center in a conversation as opposed to flattening everything down to &quot;BIPOC&quot;, which decenters over a billion people of color who face white supremacist oppression that already gets even less emphasis in American discourse.

This toxicity amounts to nothing compared to the American military's legacy of white supremacy, most recently with millions of dead, displaced, and mutilated Iraqi and Afghani civilians. <br>

The American military is the most powerful and accomplished white supremacist force on the planet. And its &quot;greatest&quot; accomplishments against people of color happened before Trump. Trump just pardoned the war criminals Obama didn't get a chance to rescue from accountability.<br>

<em>I appreciate that the author is drawing attention to Britain's culpability in colonialism, and making a case for Britain paying reparations. But he doesn't need to diminish the long-lasting effects (including political, economic and cultural structures) of other empires and other colonizers to make his point. I don't think it would hurt his argument to acknowledge that there are other historical empires and other colonialists (the Dutch in Southeast Asia, France in Africa and Asia, Japan in East Asia and Southeast Asia, for example) that have had similar long-lasting impact up until the present-day, and that they should pay reparations as well.</em><br>
<br>
If you note one of my earlier responses, I point out that this applies to the rest of Europe and the United States as well. My particular interest in British reparations is both deeply personal and pragmatic: it is the country closest to the United States in both its general culture and imperialist legacy.<br>
<br>
As for Japan, I am very curious as to why Westerners are so obsessed with non-white countries and what these countries should do with regard to reparations, especially when...<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_reparations#World_War_II_Japan">they already did it</a>.

<em>Would the activities of Gandhi, a Hindu, have been tolerated in either of these empires? Would democracy and the idea of human rights have emerged from them?</em><br>
<br>
Additionally, the piece forcefully responds to this bizarre defense of colonialism:
<blockquote>Democracy? British rule was dictatorship!  Africans and Asians struggled and bled for the right to vote in their own countries.  Property rights? The whole point of colonialism was dispossession—securing the rights of the colonizers to the property of the colonized: land, gold, diamonds, taxes, even the bodies of the colonized themselves. Rule of law? The object of colonial legal codes was to deny equal rights to colonial subjects.  And India’s railroads were used to pump resources—grain and timber—out of the hinterlands to the ports for British use. <br>
<br>
Even if we accept that useful things were shared during colonialism – universities, for instance – that is not the same as saying they were a benefit of colonization. Colonialism is not a necessary vector for the transfer of knowledge or technology. Britain has long enjoyed the Arabic numeral system, algorithms, and even algebra itself, without ever submitting to Arab invasion. It takes a warped mind to believe that the best way to share ideas with other humans is to colonize them.</blockquote>

And:
<blockquote>Even if there was a kind of “net good” that came out of colonialism, that is not a defense that would be admissible in any court of law.  Imagine if we were trying a man for murdering one of his children, and his defense was that he was good to his family most of the time, fed and clothed them, and even sometimes bought them nice things.  Such a defense would obviously be absurd.  Indeed, even if the man had treated his family like royalty, this clearly would not compensate for the fact that he murdered his child.  We would never say of such a man, “Well, overall he was a good person, so let us leave him alone.” <br>
<br>
Only a jury committed to preserving the absolute rights of patriarchy would ever acquit such a man on these grounds.  So too, only those who on some level presuppose European supremacy would ever acquit Britain on the grounds of some kind of “net good” argument.</blockquote>

<em>The main problem that I see with the idea of restitutions is the question of &quot;how far back does one go?&quot;</em> <br>
<br>
Have you read the entire article? The author responds to many common counterpoints, including this exact one you have posted:
<blockquote><strong>2. “There were lots of empires in world history: the Mongols, Rome, Japan and so on.  If Britain must pay reparations, then we should demand reparations from all historical empires, and that is absurd.”</strong><br>
<br>
You certainly won’t find a defense of these past empires on my lips.  I am a staunch anti-imperialist, and always will be.  Give me a chance to broaden my argument, to critique empire itself, and I will gladly do so.  But two points.  First, the proposition in question has to do with Britain – that is what’s under debate.  So this is a red herring.  <strong>Second, the Mongols did not design a global economic system that remains in place today.  Britain did – and this is precisely the core of my argument: that there is a fundamental continuity between the international economic system that was consolidated from 1600 to 1950, and the one that exists today. </strong> <br>
<br>
There are some obvious signs of this.  Who controls the World Bank, the IMF and the WTO, the three key institutions that govern the rules of the global economy? Voting power in the WB and IMF is monopolized by a small handful of rich nations: the US, Britain, France, Germany, Japan.  Meanwhile the global South, which has some 85% of the world’s population, has less than 50% of the vote.  In other words, even if the vast majority of the world voted to change WB and IMF policy, they would not be able to do so.  <br>
<br>
What about the WTO?  Bargaining power in the WTO is determined by market size, so economies like Britain virtually always get their way.  In other words, the inequalities that were generated during the colonial era now structure who has power in the global economy.  Inequality begets inequality.  This is hardly surprising.  Remember: the Bretton Woods institutions were founded in 1944, before the end of colonialism.  <strong>That’s why colonies like India were integrated into the system on profoundly unequal terms.  Indeed, that was the whole point</strong>.</blockquote>

<em>but I think there is a very common focus on the “uniqueness” of the WWII Holocaust, when in fact one of the most horrifying things about it in my opinion is how common genocide is.</em><br>
<br>
I think the WWII Holocaust is unique in a number of ways though: 1) the perpetrators were held accountable and 2) <a href="https://qz.com/1680558/for-slavery-reparations-the-us-can-look-to-post-holocaust-germany/">they paid reparations</a>. And while neither can ever be enough for such monstrous crimes against humanity, it provides clarity on what justice can look like.<br>
<br>
And remarkably, to dive deeper into this history also reveals the deeply connected nature of <strong>all</strong> our histories: <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/30/how-american-racism-influenced-hitler">Hitler was profoundly inspired by both British colonialism and American white supremacy</a>:
<blockquote>Hitler and Goebbels were the first relativizers of the Holocaust, the first purveyors of false equivalence. “Concentration camps were not invented in Germany,” Hitler said in 1941. “It is the English who are their inventors, using this institution to gradually break the backs of other nations.” The British had operated camps in South Africa, the Nazis pointed out. Party propagandists similarly highlighted the sufferings of Native Americans and Stalin’s slaughter in the Soviet Union.<br>
<br>
[...]<br>
<br>
Jim Crow laws in the American South served as a precedent in a stricter legal sense. Scholars have long been aware that Hitler’s regime expressed admiration for American race law, but they have tended to see this as a public-relations strategy—an “everybody does it” justification for Nazi policies. Whitman, however, points out that if these comparisons had been intended solely for a foreign audience they would not have been buried in hefty tomes in Fraktur type. “Race Law in the United States,” a 1936 study by the German lawyer Heinrich Krieger, attempts to sort out inconsistencies in the legal status of nonwhite Americans. Krieger concludes that the entire apparatus is hopelessly opaque, concealing racist aims behind contorted justifications. Why not simply say what one means? This was a major difference between American and German racism.<br>
</blockquote>

<em>Actual Holocaust denialism is alive and well in the UK, and shouldn't be bolstered by conflating intentional genocide with unintentional mass-slaughter - even due to intentional misrule. I think he could make the same points without de-centering another set of victims.</em><br>
<br>
From the famines to the slave trade, these were <strong>also</strong> intentional and systematic genocides. It is not de-centering another set of victims to acknowledge this horrifying reality of actual holocausts denied and/or celebrated by the vast majority of British people.<br>
<br>
&quot;Colonialism&quot; is far too mild to describe these atrocities. Look at how even in this discussion, these horrors are bogglingly described as &quot;intentional misrule&quot;. That in itself is an astonishing minimization and &quot;<em>de-centering</em>&quot; of what happened.<br>
<br>
This should not be a contest of who gets to claim a term used to describe such horrifying crimes against humanity. I would rather have solidarity against all forms of genocide denialism than a competition.

From the Teen Vogue piece, this is an important complexity that is often erased in conversations about &quot;Asian-Americans&quot;:
<blockquote>The myth of Asian American success is as fraught as it is malicious, benefiting some and erasing others. According to the same 2017 Pew report, Indian Americans have a median annual household income of $100,000 — well above the American average — with Filipino and Japanese Americans not too far behind. On the other end are four groups well below the average: Bangladeshi, Burmese, Nepalese, and Hmong Americans, the ethnic group to which Tou Thao belongs.<br>
<br>
As writer Jay Caspian Kang argued in his May 28 Substack newsletter, it is always the “elite-educated, upwardly mobile East Asians” who try to act as the moral arbiters for other Asians. This is not to rescue Thao from condemnation, but more to criticize the tendency for wealthy, privileged Asians to use groups like the Hmongs to not “so much come out and confront anti-Blackness ‘in our community,’ but rather to disassociate oneself from the racist in the video.”</blockquote>

It is important for all races to come together in the fight against white supremacy, but as that piece discusses elsewhere, it requires material action, not self-aggrandizing apologia.

<em>As a point of comparison, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had support by a virtual 2:1 margin (58% to 31%).</em><br>
<br>
From the very article you listed:
<blockquote>But while the public supported civil rights legislation conceptually, they expressed concerns about the pace of its implementation. Indeed, although most supported the new civil rights law soon after it was passed, a national Opinion Research Corporation poll showed 68% of Americans wanting to see moderation in its enforcement, with only 19% wanting vigorous enforcement of the new law.<br>
<br>
Moderate Enforcement of 1964 Law PreferredIn that light, it is not surprising that in early 1965, a Gallup poll found growing numbers of Americans saying that the Johnson administration was moving too fast overall on integration. In March, 34% held that view, and by May that sentiment rose to 45%, with only 14% expressing the view that it was not moving fast enough.</blockquote>

No one contends with the absolute reality of tradeoffs, but why hasn't the liberal/moderate coalition in charge of the opposition for the past few decades been able to secure more progress thanks to all the tradeoffs made on the backs of people of color and the poor?<br>
<br>
It's not surprising they have lost so much credibility with the millions of people protesting against police brutality in blue (in more than one way) cities.

<blockquote>“The #8CantWait policing program is so superficial as to be meaningless,” John Raphling, criminal legal system researcher for Human Rights Watch, said in a press release. “It allows mayors and police chiefs to say they’re doing something without actually making the changes that are needed.” Raphling calls such a campaign a “dangerous distraction” and “empty words.” To that point, the Mayor of Tampa boasted last week that the city’s police department already follows #8CantWait’s policies on the same day the Tampa Bay Times reported that police attacked largely peaceful protesters with smoke, gas, and non-lethal bullets.<br>

“I haven’t seen specific campaigns like this that have generated this type of attention,” Raphling told Gizmodo via email. “But, it fits a pattern of distracting from more fundamental reforms by offering superficial changes. For example, changing the wording of the standard from ‘reasonable’ to ‘necessary,’ (California AB 392) doesn’t really change police behavior, just what they have to say to justify their actions.” Last year, following a rash of police shootings of unarmed citizens, California passed the Act to Save Lives, which raised the legal justification for deadly force to “only when necessary in defense of human life.”</blockquote>

This was a really great piece that I'm sending to my white friends who are struggling to understand what to do beyond protesting and donating. This footnote resonated with me, particularly in terms of my experiences on Metafilter and other white-dominated discussion spaces:
<blockquote>I will not address the issue of intersectionality in this discussion. My comments will be focused upon the issue of race and white supremacy. While I understand that we experience racial issues differently depending on our class, gender, and sexuality, I think it is vital that the issue of white supremacy is addressed as directly as possible and without distraction. In the final analysis, which this is not, I think bell hooks is correct when she describes our current system as an interlocking system of domination made up essentially of white supremacy-capitalism-patriarchy and as such represents a complex web of differential experiences. <strong>But intersectionality, I believe can also be deployed as a distraction, particularly by liberal white people who, in my experience, would like to talk about almost anything—gender, sexuality even class—before engaging in a critical analysis of white identity construction, white supremacy, and questions of culpability and privilege.</strong></blockquote>

<br>
Beyond the persistent representation of a cop as the main character, another way shows/movies/books seriously distort the public's thinking on this topic is to treat crime and violence as an individual, acute act by an antagonist. In this way, downstream problems will always require downstream solutions. The worse the singular crime, the harder the singular cop (or cops) has to be.<br>
<br>
In reality, crime and violence are the products of massive systems of oppression and deprivation across generations. The issue is that those stories aren't as easily told or enjoyed, especially by a society fed a far more simplistic narrative of why crimes happen.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, if violence is the mainstream currency of narrative action and the police have a monopoly on violence, it is difficult for a society to imagine a different kind of entertainment, let alone a different kind of world.

<em>Is that what Kendi's anti-racist syllabus advocates and the books on the list teach their readers? The White Fragility book advocates an absence of tension? That The Autobiography of Malcolm X is shallow, and has nothing to say about imperialism or capitalism? That Between the World and Me says nothing about the toxicity embedded in our political culture and that Ta-Nehisi Coates is saying comfortable, comforting things to white people so they can be happy in their symbolic color-blindness?</em><br>
<br>
That's the entire point of the original article. <em>These lists do not teach their readers</em>. For example, I have met so many white people and people of color who have read The Autobiography of Malcolm X and walked away learning nothing at all from it other than some pithy quotes or a revolutionary aesthetic facade to paint over &quot;good&quot;.<br>
<br>
Funnily enough, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/17/ta-nehisi-coates-neoliberal-black-struggle-cornel-west">Ta-Nehisi Coates and his inability to connect anti-racism to anti-capitalism and anti-imperialism is an excellent example of what I am talking about</a>:
<blockquote>The disagreement between Coates and me is clear: any analysis or vision of our world that omits the centrality of Wall Street power, US military policies, and the complex dynamics of class, gender, and sexuality in black America is too narrow and dangerously misleading. So it is with Ta-Nehisi Coates’ worldview.<br>
<br>
Coates rightly highlights the vicious legacy of white supremacy – past and present. He sees it everywhere and ever reminds us of its plundering effects. Unfortunately, he hardly keeps track of our fightback, and never connects this ugly legacy to the predatory capitalist practices, imperial policies (of war, occupation, detention, assassination) or the black elite’s refusal to confront poverty, patriarchy or transphobia.</blockquote>

<em>I don’t disagree with what you’re saying, but the military is also as diverse or possibly more diverse than the US population as a whole, something like 43% non-white or Hispanic. Police forces are often much more white than the populations they police.</em><br>
<br>
Ignoring the fact that much of that 43% of &quot;diversity&quot; does not trickle up to leadership, the military commits these war crimes against a population that is <strong>100 percent people of color</strong>.  And how many of those soldiers are Iraqi-American or Afghani-American?<br>
<br>
Diversity is not a shield for white supremacy.<br>
<br>
<em>Also, not to defend militarization, but as mentioned above, a huge part of the problem is giving deadly gear to corrupt, racist organizations without the training and rules in place to use it appropriately. (The other part being that it isn’t appropriate to use that stuff against civilians in the first place.) But the military isn’t responsible for the militarization of police forces, so they don’t deserve criticism for that.</em><br>
<br>
Yes, the politicians who dump trillions of dollars into the military and their forever wars rightly deserve criticism for it. But the military is still a crucial part of police militarization.

To build on another one of johnasdf's points: if the goal is to understand how to dismantle white supremacy, these reading lists are often <em>terrible</em> because they are so shallow and rarely include anything on anti-capitalism, anti-imperialism, and ultimately, the topic of systemic power itself.<br>
<br>
And what do you get when you have an understanding of racism that does not incorporate anti-capitalism and anti-imperialism?<br>
<br>
You get the &quot;good&quot; of the Obama years, where countless people of color died in liberal cities and states like San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, and even more people of color died in drone/cruise missile strikes personally authorized by Obama himself. Reading lists like those are dangerous in their own way because they lull readers into thinking all we need is &quot;good&quot;.

<em>I do, however, interact with military officers from various branches in the course of my job, and personally respect many of them. I'm aware of the profound respect Mattis carries among these people, and how that filters out and down to many levels.</em><br>
<br>
This is a strange response to the point that the U.S. military has been a force for white supremacist genocide and war crimes for <em>centuries</em>.<br>
<br>
This akin to saying &quot;but I know nice cops!&quot; after someone points out the countless white supremacist atrocities committed by police, which is particularly ironic given all of this discourse has sprung up from protests against a century of white supremacist police brutality.<br>
<br>
Moreover, the idea of a respectable military that we should be grateful for is even more surreal considering police brutality significantly increased when the police became <b>militarized</b>. The weapons, vehicles, and tactics were imported by the police from the military as the forever war on drugs and crime mixed together with the forever war on &quot;terror&quot;. And to top it all off, the trillions of dollars spent on these vast budgets for white supremacist empire and policing deprive people of color and the poor of years of life due to long-term material deprivation and suffering.<br>
<br>
The suffering of people of color at the hands of the US military is deeply connected to the suffering of people of color inside America. We see that playing out every single day of these protests even before the National Guard got involved.<br>
<br>
If &quot;woke&quot; military leaders can prevent mass casualty events in America, that's a good thing. But just like the police, the American military will still remain a problem for people of color abroad and domestically.

<br>
Since Trump's ascension in 2015, I have been afraid of war criminals/Never Trumpers like Frum, Bret Stephens (New York Times), and Max Boot (Washington Post) being able to successfully launder their reputations in the eyes of liberals and centrists who don't (or don't want to) know better in order to parasitize themselves onto whatever liberal/progressive movement comes after Trump.<br>
<br>

<em> I know Mattis isn’t always a favorite around here</em><br>
<br>
This is some of the most remarkable euphemizing I have ever seen on here. Let's not mince words here: <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/03/01/trumps-moderate-defense-secretary-has-already-brought-us-to-the-brink-of-war/">Mattis is a white supremacist and a war criminal</a>.
<blockquote>Mattis has, in fact, been tied to some of the worst war crimes of the Iraq invasion. It was he who gave the order to attack the village of Mukaradeeb in April 2004 — a decision he would later admit took him only 30 seconds to approve — which killed 42 civilians, including 13 children, who were attending a wedding there. “I don’t have to apologize for the conduct of my men,” he told reporters.<br>
<br>
Six months later, in November 2004, it was Mattis who planned the Marine assault on Fallujah that reduced that city to rubble, forced 200,000 residents from their homes, and resulted, according to the Red Cross, in at least 800 civilian deaths.<br>
<br>
</blockquote>

Let's be clear here: America committed a white supremacist genocide in Iraq by killing, maiming, and displacing millions of people of color in less than a decade. The American war crimes we know of are but a fraction of what actually happened in Iraq. Sadly, genocides and war crimes are prosecuted by those with the biggest weapons and so, America (and Mattis) will never be held accountable for these atrocities.<br>
<br>
If Mattis's actions now do some modicum of good somehow, that's at least some good news. But that does not do anything to negate the war crimes he has already committed; he is still a white supremacist and a war criminal who has not been held accountable for his actions and should not be celebrated in any way by anyone who wants to be taken seriously as an anti-racist. <br>
<br>
&quot;Useful&quot; is not the same thing as &quot;Good&quot;.

I have marched at too many protests against police brutality (and war crimes) during the Obama years to feel anything other than deep antipathy, disgust, and distrust towards him and any other leader who thinks reforms are all we need.<br>
<br>
As I posted earlier, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/157955/media-elites-police-protests">please do not think more leadership is what we need</a>:
<blockquote>The liberal amnesia over Bush (and his father) should not obscure how little the other former presidents might have to offer here. Barack Obama was president when Michael Brown’s killing led to the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, and when Freddie Gray’s death at the police’s hands led to unrest in Baltimore. (At the time, Obama condemned the “criminals and thugs” who looted and destroyed property in Baltimore.) Obama was undoubtedly a better leader than Trump, in both actions and words. It’s very likely that Trump’s predecessor, with his more humane rhetoric and his soothing voice, is exactly the leader that people are imagining, if only because the obvious contrast lives so rivetingly in our short-term memory.<br>
<br>
Yet Obama’s statesmanship did not save those lives or the lives of unarmed black people who have been shot by police since then. His ability to speak and make the nation listen did not make the cops listen—which should tell you something about the limitations of the bully pulpit. The solution to this crisis is not to cry out for a leader to quiet the disruption. It’s for the protesters to get what they want. That means throwing this current crop of so-called leaders out, not asking for them to sing us back to sleep.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Black and brown people experience very different treatment from the police than white people do, and it’s so endemic that the police just can’t help themselves. I thought the most compelling example of that was how differently the CNN reporters were treated in Minneapolis. A white CNN reporter is basically on the same ground, doing the same thing — while cops roll up on the black reporter and arrest him, cops go to the white reporter and say, “We’d like you to move, please,” and he says, “Okay.” But he doesn’t move as far as they would like and they say, “Could you please move some more?” And he says, “Sure.”<br>
<br>
The thing that’s so revealing about that is that it all happens on national television, at a rally about excessive force and racist policing. I could just imagine, at the roll call that morning for the officers, when they’re getting their instructions from the sergeant, the sergeant says, “Okay, guys, we know that we’re guarding this rally about police brutality and discriminatory enforcement; let’s not be racist, don’t be racist, it’s really important that we not be racist today.” And they still can’t help themselves.</blockquote>

<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/157955/media-elites-police-protests">The Political Elites’ Pointless Calls for More Leadership</a>:
<blockquote>A demand for More Leadership is essentially meaningless without substance or denoting any particular kind of action at all. It tells us nothing about what sort of solutions you want your leaders to enact, or even what problem you really want to solve. It’s a half-step more sophisticated than saying someone should do something about all the problems. This is why Swisher’s proposal is so poor: It would accomplish little more than shine people on that something was being done. A bipartisan group of former presidents Saying Something would give the false impression that Saying Something is all that needs to happen for us to make change or simply move on. The fires might be put out for a time, but the kindling would remain.</blockquote>

<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/06/killing-of-george-floyd-shows-our-over-reliance-on-police.html">We Are Asking the Police to Do too Much</a>:
<blockquote>But while de Blasio is feckless, he’s no outlier. Since Minneapolis police killed George Floyd and sparked a national wave of unrest, many Democrats in positions of power were more eager to delegitimize or shut down protests than they were to challenge the police. In Minnesota, Governor Tim Walz claimed, without offering proof, that outside agitators had inflamed his state; and in the city of St. Paul, the Democratic mayor claimed, falsely, that most of the protesters his cops had arrested came in from out of state too. The mayor, Melvin Carter, later blamed the police for misleading him. In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti has called for the National Guard; since protests began, the police in his city have arrested motorists at random and fired rubber bullets and tear gas into crowds.<br>
<br>
It is easy and, for liberals, ideologically convenient to blame Donald Trump for emboldening the police. The president is a racist, shaped by an unshakable conviction in the innate criminal tendencies of black and brown people. But the problem is much bigger, and much older, than the Trump presidency. Democrats might lack the specific ethno-nationalist predilections of the GOP, but when it comes to the police, the parties are both subservient. Minus a few critics, stashed in various levels of power, Democrats and Republicans alike have surrendered civilian power to the police.<br>
<br>
[...]<br>
<br>
Police departments don’t write laws. They can’t cut spending on welfare, and schools, and health care. Politicians did that, have been doing it for decades. But as the state atrophies, it leaves behind absences. Lawmakers rely on the police to fill in the gaps, which are now so large they resemble horizons. It can be difficult to imagine that we could ever be anything more than what we are now, and hardly anyone in power seems willing to try. Cop unions push for more money and for fancier weapons and against criminal-justice reforms that would decrease the demand for their services.<br>
<br>
Both parties are too happy to concede. After heavy lobbying from the New York City police, de Blasio and his traditional nemesis, Governor Cuomo, both supported a bill reversing bail reforms that helped keep poor New Yorkers out of jail. In May, de Blasio introduced a budget that would cut funding for the Department of Education by $827 million. The NYPD, meanwhile, can expect a cut of just $23.8 million the same year.<br>
<br>
[...]<br>
<br>
A moral and cultural failure does exist. But the architects of broken-windows policing misidentified its source, and so do their descendants. Did the people fail the state or did the state fail the people? The liberal politician might concede the latter. He may even approve some new welfare spending or, in the case of de Blasio, experiment with programs like universal pre-K. On the subject of the police, and incarceration, they advocate body cameras and civilian review boards. But that’s often where they stop. The police still know they can beat, shoot, and kill with almost complete impunity in blue and red states alike. Mayors like de Blasio will defend them and repeat their version of events to the press. Governors like Cuomo will give them more money. Democratic voters will nominate the architect of the 1994 crime bill to be president. Matters will go on as usual — unless protesters force a true reckoning.<br>
<br>
To those who oppose it, this reckoning will always look violent, opportunistic, unnecessary. But nothing else has worked. Voting in Democrats didn’t keep George Floyd alive. It didn’t save Eric Garner here in New York. The protests that erupt daily in Brooklyn, and Minneapolis, and Los Angeles, and Philadelphia, started with the police and with their enablers in office. They follow decades of dysfunction, institutional decay, and neglect. Stoked again by the pandemic, and by mass unemployment that lawmakers could address if so moved, protesters strike at the American order itself. The police, they know, exist to keep them in line, and in place.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Between 1993 and 2012, real per capita spending on our punishment bureaucracy grew by 40 percent nationwide, according to an analysis of Bureau of Justice Statistics data by President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers. <strong>That same report estimated that the combined costs of policing, courts, and corrections account for around half of all direct local government spending</strong>. Overlapping jurisdictional responsibilities make direct comparisons difficult, but in some cities—including Memphis and Oakland—police departments can account for around 40 percent of spending. A 2017 report analyzed budgets in 12 metropolitan jurisdictions and found that police spending “vastly outpaces expenditures in vital community resources and services”—amounting to as much as $772 annually per resident, in Baltimore.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...There’s 50 years of research on violence at protests, dating back to the three federal commissions formed between 1967 and 1970. All three concluded that when police escalate force — using weapons, tear gas, mass arrests and other tools to make protesters do what the police want — those efforts can often go wrong, creating the very violence that force was meant to prevent. For example, the Kerner Commission, which was formed in 1967 to specifically investigate urban riots, found that police action was pivotal in starting half of the 24 riots the commission studied in detail. It recommended that police eliminate “abrasive policing tactics” and that cities establish fair ways to address complaints against police.<br>
<br>
Experts say the following decades of research have turned up similar findings. Escalating force by police leads to more violence, not less. It tends to create feedback loops, where protesters escalate against police, police escalate even further, and both sides become increasingly angry and afraid.</blockquote>

<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/06/rioters-at-the-george-floyd-protests-dont-want-sympathy.html">The Rioters Aren’t Here to Convince You</a>:
<blockquote>A more reductive but commonly expressed version of this claim holds that rioters are insincerely committed to their alleged grievances. They’re burning buildings; therefore, they don’t actually care about racist law enforcement — or so the reasoning goes. But the notion that even the most disruptive and lawless manifestations of unrest haven’t sought to establish an alternative social order seems easily refuted; the most politically significant example of property destruction last week was the siege and incineration of the Minneapolis Police’s 3rd Precinct. In almost every city where rioting has occurred, the consistent theme has been the targeting of police vehicles for wreckage and officers for pelting with projectiles. This is not the behavior of people trying to make friends on Capitol Hill or endear themselves to the median white voter. Given decades of precedent and the immediate precipitating factors — a police officer kneeling fatally on the neck of a gasping black man, a pandemic that’s killed thousands of people and cost millions their jobs, an upswell of police violence against unarmed protesters — these riots are more likely an effort to upwardly redistribute the contempt that the current order and its guardians have shown toward them. Individual motives no doubt vary. But generally, the target seems less positive attention from skeptics and undecided voters than negative attention from police and representatives of the governing order.<br>
<br>
This isn’t to say that the unrest is defined by ideological, strategic, or even demographic uniformity. Despite the absence of precise statistics, it’s apparent from documentary evidence that the rioters aren’t all black or even all nonwhite; that a majority of demonstrators practicing principled nonviolence exists alongside a small minority of anarchist and other black-bloc rioters practicing principled destruction; that many of their less ideologically committed compatriots have turned to arson and looting after recalculating what the law’s demonstrations of illegitimacy mean for how much they’re required to respect it. Perhaps some of them are agents provocateurs. It seems almost certain that there’s a generational component, as well — an outcry from young people facing recent history’s most dismal economic prospects at the hands of their elders.</blockquote>

<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/06/riots-are-american-way-george-floyd-protests/612466/">The Double Standard of the American Riot</a>:
<blockquote>Since the beginning of this country, riots and violent rhetoric have been markers of patriotism. When our Founding Fathers fought for independence, violence was the clarion call. Phrases such as “Live free or die,” “Give me liberty or give me death,” and “Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God” echoed throughout the nation, and continue today. Force and violence have always been used as weapons to defend liberty, because—as John Adams once said in reference to the colonists’ treatment by the British—“We won’t be their Negroes.”<br>
<br>
Black rebellion and protest, though, have historically never been coupled with allegiance to American democracy. Today, peaceful demonstrations and violent riots alike have erupted across the country in response to police brutality and the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery. Yet the language used to refer to protesters has included looters, thugs, and even claims that they are un-American. The philosophy of force and violence to obtain freedom has long been employed by white people and explicitly denied to black Americans.<br>
<br>
Think back to March 5, 1770, when Crispus Attucks, a man of African and Native American descent, became the first casualty of the American Revolution. Attucks was one of a handful of protesters killed by British forces during the Boston Massacre. The lawyer tasked with defending the British soldiers in their American criminal trial was none other than Adams. When presenting his case, Adams described the men those soldiers killed as “a motley rabble of saucy boys, negroes and molattoes [sic], Irish teagues and outlandish jack tarrs.” He built his defense of the British soldiers on the charge that Attucks struck the first blow and led the “dreadful carnage.” Adams concluded that the “mad behavior” of Attucks provoked the soldiers’ response, saying that Attucks’s group was “under the command of a stout molatto fellow, whose very looks, was enough to terrify any person.” Some 250 years later, Adams’s words still underline a central truth in American disobedience: Freedom through violence is a privilege possessed only by whites. Seminal moments in U.S. history that historians have defined as patriotic were also moments that denied patriotism to black people.</blockquote>

<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/157942/tear-gas-doesnt-deploy">Tear Gas Doesn’t Deploy Itself</a>:
<blockquote>Save for the rare clip of someone like Cornel West speaking God’s honest truth on CNN, mainstream media coverage of the nationwide protests against racist policing largely follows the same rules: mealy-mouthed language when describing police violence; clear, active language when describing confrontation initiated by protesters; and a both-sides approach to escalation that frames militarized police and protesters with lighters and water bottles as equally positioned. Responding over the weekend to a particularly egregious example of this kind of reporting, Vox writer Katelyn Burns observed: “Dang where did the pepper spray come from?”<br>
<br>
Coverage tends to look like this because the media focuses on looting and property destruction to entice viewership and fulfill the outrage cycle, but also because mainstream news outlets are institutions that often have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo when it comes to policing, racist violence, and other systems that are disproportionately deadly for Black people and people of color. They don’t want to lose their imagined sense of objectivity or piss off their older white viewers, and so they do everything they can to talk around the elephant in the room: Police are, and have always been, violent as hell. As 60 Minutes correspondent and former Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery put it, because so few people in America fully understand how its history of racism is ongoing and not locked in the past, “it’s impossible to say objectively true, historically neutral things grounded in research, reporting &amp; expertise without a large swath of [people] (including journalists) interpreting them as ‘political opinions.’”</blockquote>

<em>Trump has declared war on peaceful Americans from his underground bunker. While it isn't about him, specifically, it kind of is about exercise and abuses of power by him, as well as others.</em><br>
<br>
As mentioned before, many of the instances of police/white supremacist violence that people have protested over the last 8 years have happened in liberal cities and liberal states (and before Trump was in office). It may feel like a million years ago, but Black Lives Matter formed during Obama's second term.<br>
<br>
Trump's reaction is uniquely horrifying, even for a conservative, but people of color being brutalized by the police, vigilantes, and the larger capitalist system has been the American way of life since long before Trump was born.<br>
<br>
To reduce this down to a conservative or Trump issue is to reduce away the deaths of Eric Garner, Oscar Grant, Ezell Ford, Bettie Jones, Philando Castile, and countless others who lived in the most &quot;liberal&quot; cities in America.<br>
<br>
An absence of Trump or even the GOP will not stop these atrocities from happening again.

<a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/05/outside-agitator-racial-justice-protests-minneapolis-george-floyd/">Don’t Fall for the Myth of the “Outside Agitator” in Racial Justice Protests</a>:
<blockquote>Why does this matter? The “outside agitator” trope is today often accompanied by a tirade against “white anarchists” or “Antifa” carrying out the rebellion — while people of color don’t. This is an attempt to isolate and weaken protesters from each other, to make the “good” protesters distrustful and paranoid about “infiltration” by white radicals. (Radicals of color, meanwhile, are nowhere to be found.) Fostering distrust among developing coalitions is a quick and easy way to ensure their swift demise.<br>
<br>
These accusations have long popped up in response to civil rights struggles. In 1965, the White Citizens’ Council posted over two hundred billboards throughout the South attempting to discredit Martin Luther King Jr by associating him with communism. One, which shows a photo of King attending a 1957 event at the Highlander Folk School, a key training site for many civil rights activists, is titled “Martin Luther King at Communist Training School.” On the billboard, a giant, cartoonish arrow points directly to King.<br>
<br>
[...]<br>
<br>
In 2020, the phrase, and these tactics, have once again reared their ugly head. The myth of “outside agitators” is being simultaneously weaponized by conservatives and liberals to demean and intimidate protesters. We shouldn’t let them — it’s an accusation designed to downplay the widespread anger so many are feeling and acting on in this country.<br>
<br>
King warned us, “We must all learn to live together as brothers or we will all perish together as fools.”<br>
<br>
Don’t fall for defenders of the status quo continuing to blame “outside agitators” for the rebellions sweeping the country right now — they want us to perish together as fools.</blockquote>

The ratio for American Indian men was 2.23 (3.37% of stops of men, but 1.51% of the male population).

<a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/05/29/george-floyd-minneapolis-police-reform/">The George Floyd killing exposes the failures of police reform</a>:
<blockquote>“Reform is not the answer, we’ve been trying it for decades, and as you can see, we’re just not getting anywhere,” he said. “We need a new paradigm of policing in the United States. It needs to be completely dismantled and reconstructed, not changing a policy here or there.”<br>
<br>
[...]<br>
<br>
“The whole idea was that if police had implicit bias training, so more money for training police, and were using technology for more accountability, and that if police officers were more respectful when they’re interacting with the community, that that will promote a better idea of policing, and more cooperation with police,” said Nancy Heitzeg, a sociology professor at St. Catherine University in Minneapolis, who has studied the initiative.<br>
<br>
“That was the theory,” she said. “And what does it say about the limits of reform that the city of Minneapolis and the Minneapolis police department could be part of a multi-year, multimillion-dollar national project to enhance police community relations, and after all of that, here we are?”<br>
<br>
After years of investment in improved policing with no results to show for it, “the conversation has changed,” she added. “There’s much more of a public awareness and conversation about abolition, and what that means and what that might look like. … I think people were radicalized by Jamar Clark and Philando Castile. And then they saw the contradictions around Justine Damond.”</blockquote>

The white supremacist, bipartisan consensus on policing is deadly and reforms are a small bandage on systemic oppression.

<blockquote><strong>But should we care about the looting of stores like Target and Autozone?<br>
<br>
</strong>This was the destruction of property by people enraged over the murder of an innocent black man by a white police officer. Should we, like Martin Luther King’s “white moderate,” equivocate about an anti-racist uprising?<br>
<br>
Should we blame working-class black people for lashing out at a government and economy designed to repress, exploit, and subdue them; during a pandemic in which capitalism has made it near impossible for them to survive? Should we participate in this ritual condemnation even though our media consistently treats identical acts of property destruction by sports fans as simply revelry and exuberance, and corporate looting of working-class communities as business as usual?<br>
<br>
No. George Floyd mattered. Black lives matter. And until we can build a movement that can defeat racism and capitalism, until working people of all races unite against capitalists and their repressive apparatus, it is a good thing that bosses, government officials, and the police who protect them are sometimes reminded that black lives matter through a little proletarian fury.<br>
<br>
If you care about looting, turn your eyes to the militaries, the police, the pharmaceutical companies, the private equity ghouls, the landlords, the real estate speculators, and the billionaires. And demand that a world once looted from the vast majority be now returned to them.</blockquote>

<em>I think the real solution would be for these cops to suddenly find themselves in prison among the general population. Once they realize prosecutors, juries and judges no longer have any qualms about making killers actually pay for their crimes, maybe some actual attitude change will happen.</em><br>
<br>
Or this just leads to police officers and prosecutors covering up these cases even more harshly than they already do.<br>
<br>
Prisons in America are terrible and desperately need to be reformed. And it isn't as though they have provided any sort of significant deterrent to criminality.

Police unions don't serve and protect the public; <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/07/black-lives-matter-patrick-lynch-ferguson">they serve and protect the interests of white supremacy and capitalism (which are closely tied to each other)</a>:
<blockquote>When confronted with information of police unions’ misdeeds, many progressives accuse the bearer of anti-union animus. But if the Black Lives Matter movement has taught us anything, it’s that cops are different from other public-sector employees.<br>
<br>
Social workers and teachers don’t fire bullets into the hearts and heads of unarmed people, or impose brute order when social unrest proves too acute for less coercive pacification. The word “union” shouldn’t be treated as an acid bath that magically disappears this social function. As Kristian Williams reminds us in his indispensable Our Enemies in Blue, “Police organize as police, not workers.”<br>
<br>
Hoping for reform-minded police unions is also delusional. The GI movement encouraged rebellion within the ranks to terminate the Vietnam War; police unions, by contrast, have repeatedly fought to retain and expand the state’s coercive apparatus.<br>
<br>
The few reform organizations that do exist — such as the National Black Police Association — have failed miserably. If anything, reform groups would benefit from being able to organize without the influence of an overarching union. The same goes for individual officers. Unencumbered by the union apparatus, it would likely be easier to convince those of good conscience to betray their occupation’s prerogatives and fight for radical causes, including the transformation of policing.</blockquote>

<em>It’s a pretty good essay with a pretty dubious premise, and the analogy fails almost immediately; Obama didn’t get to name his successor, of course. And bringing up the examples of the Founding Fathers and Churchill as people who are admired but shouldn’t be, prior to getting around to Obama is pretty bogus. “Between 384 and 807 civilians” killed by drones isn’t good, of course, but it’s also less than a rounding error compared to the civilians mowed through by his predecessor, whose stunt of landing on an aircraft carrier and prematurely declaring victory is maybe one of the closest equivalents to staging a raid on Britain’s seashells.

<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/157761/blow-restaurant-industry-start">Marian Bull - Blow Up the Restaurant Industry and Start Over</a>:
<blockquote>Still, fixing the restaurant industry isn’t just about fixing restaurants themselves. Even if you make individual workplaces more fair, you can’t remake the industry, or at least not fully, without massive changes to the systems that it operates in and around, like agriculture, real estate, and health care. “Because most people running restaurants aren’t the owners of that real estate, they can’t dictate the cost of running a business,” she explained. Commercial rents in the Bay Area are among the highest in the country, with Curbed SF reporting in 2019 that retail rental sites that year posted “record increases in average prices almost every month, breaking all-time high records not just once but several times.” (Just last week, a restaurant an hour north of the city closed after 46 years because its landlord hit it with a staggering 300 percent rent increase.) <br>
<br>
And owners have long relied on exploitation, not just of their servers making $2.13 an hour (the national tipped minimum wage) or of undocumented back-of-house workers, but also, at a distance, of the agricultural workers growing and processing the food served on their tables, from farms to meat and poultry plants. Any attempt to “fix” restaurants must also include a fight for fair wages, reliable benefits, safe conditions, and workplace democracy for workers in the industries that restaurants rely on, not just the workers placing the fried chicken sandwich on the table. Unfortunately, Wey said, “a lot of people have a difficult time imagining a system that doesn’t exploit people.” (Just look at how take-out customers are tipping horribly during the pandemic.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>EL: Because you're right, anybody who really starts seriously reviewing somebody who's desperately trying to stay in business by offering takeout and delivery really deserves to be ex-communicated from the restaurant critic association.<br>
<br>
PW: Right. So as a journalist, you could say this is available, you know which The Times has been doing. Florence Fabricant’s been rounding and finding some interesting stuff here, people doing lobster dinners here. So you can certainly do that. This is available. This is an option that you might choose to avail yourself of. But to sort of, I don’t know… to do a thumbs up or thumbs down, forget it. And then the other part of the job is in good times is to not just say, &quot;This is good, this is garbage,&quot; but it's to take things and put them in context a little bit. And sometimes it means understanding what the chef is up to. Understanding how is northern Thai cuisine being presented in this restaurant that's different from the restaurant across the street. And none of that really applies now, nobody needs you to you know help them understand the meaning of a restaurant right now.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This is what makes SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, so effective. Last year, 35 million people received $55 billion in SNAP benefits, down from a peak of 47 million people and $76 billion in 2013. The program, which falls under the aegis of the USDA, delivers roughly nine times more food to people than the entire Feeding America network, which includes food banks.<br>
<br>
Jess Powers, who's worked with several food assistance programs, says that this method — transferring money, rather than bags of produce — is better in a lot of ways. For one thing, she says, &quot;it's just more efficient.&quot; SNAP recipients simply pay for groceries using an electronic benefits card. Also, people have more freedom to buy what they need, and the money they spend helps local businesses.</blockquote>

<em>not by letting the industry die without a replacement for those who depend on it.</em><br>
<br>
As per Wey's own words from fairly early on in the article:
<blockquote>I will say that with most of my work,  I’m always a little circumspect. So even though the sentiment has always been “let it die,” I had never said those exact words. And it wasn’t like I was super comfortable saying it! I have people who I care about who are part of that industry. So, in a way, the essay is euphemistic—only because I know it’s not going to happen, I know the restaurant industry is not going to actually die, so I have the space to be very forceful.<br>
<br>
But it wasn’t just an essay about letting things die, it’s also about what can rise from the rubble. There is something better on the other side.</blockquote>

This is a super fascinating and nuanced piece. I hope more people read all of it and not just react to the title.

<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-african-nations-are-teaching-the-west-about-fighting-the-coronavirus">What African nations are teaching the West about fighting the Coronavirus</a>:
<blockquote>Some experts point to the continent’s comparative youth: the median age in Africa is barely twenty, and studies (still) suggest that the disease is less severe in young people. Being young may help reduce mortality, but youth is a less satisfying explanation for the raw number of covid-19 cases, the majority of which have been occurring in people in their twenties and thirties. Finally, some experts speculate about the existence of a special African immunology, suggesting that diseases like malaria (or their treatments) act as biological talismans against the new disease. This coronavirus may be novel, but essentialist Western tropes about magical dark-skinned Africans date back centuries.<br>
<br>
[...]<br>
<br>
Much has also been made of how few things Africa has with which to fight the virus. Intensive-care and ventilator capacity, for example, are low, and retaining health-care workers has long been a challenge—in part because doctors and nurses can make more money by working in the West. These supply and personnel shortages are dire during a pandemic, but they don’t exist in a vacuum. They exist in relationship with the demands of the West, which drained the continent of skilled medical workers and conditioned aid on a model that demanded users, many of them living in poverty, pay fees for health service. The requirement had the effect of privatizing much of health care and effectively starved many health systems of resources. “Years of neoliberalism has basically made it impossible for African countries to build a treatment infrastructure that would include I.C.U. beds and oxygen,” Mukherjee said.</blockquote>

<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/metoo-is-more-important-than-joe-biden.html">Feminism Should Make You Uncomfortable</a>:
<blockquote>Liberal feminists had another option, which was to say nothing, and wait for more information. From a professional standpoint, delay would have been prudent; it would have also been more ideologically consistent. Democratic politicians serve feminist aims more often than their alternatives. But settling repeatedly for the least-worst name on a ballot becomes a self-reinforcing pattern. The party will shove Biden after Biden at us, and when we resist, ask us when we decided to support the nation’s Trumps instead.<br>
<br>
There is no simple way out of the predicament that Biden and his allies have created. But premature attacks on Reade boost a candidate at the expense of a movement. They tell us only that the lessons of Me Too can be set aside as soon as they are inconvenient. That strategy might serve electoral politics, but it betrays feminism. The movement exists to critique power: to identify its abuses and demand its redistribution. Accept that, and you don’t serve the political class; you’re in tension with it. That’s uncomfortable. That’s inconvenient. That’s the point.<br>
<br>
The alternative is even more distasteful. We’ll settle for Biden, and men like him, over and over; we’ll tell ourselves the conservative is worse, that at least the Democrat will make a woman his vice-president. We’ll eat scraps, and we’ll still go hungry, and all we’ll leave to our children is a political future only a little bit better than the present. Our grand prize? To clean up after men like Joe Biden. That isn’t power. It’s just women’s work.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The lack of impetus to replace Biden speaks to how Washington, D.C., has long neglected creating a culture of accountability. Some of the darkest chapters of U.S. history have been classified away. Our villainous past remains unprosecuted as bipartisan bombs continue falling. America’s lack of understanding wrongdoing enables figures who should have atoned in order for the country to progress to instead linger in political relevance.<br>
<br>
If you supervised torture and destroyed evidence, like Gina Haspel, you can still get promoted. If you’re a war criminal, like George W. Bush, you can be rehabilitated. If you’re a judge, credibly accused of sexual misconduct, like Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh, you, too, can become a Supreme Court justice.<br>
<br>
Now, high-profile Democratic endorsements for Biden signal that a quest for the truth — and a reckoning for the allegations against him — will never come.<br>
<br>
“I think that’s really what’s corrosive about this moment, is this idea that you can try to shred Tara Reade’s credibility and stick up for Joe Biden and still say that you have any kind of commitment to ending sexual violence, that you have any kind of commitment to women’s rights,” Melissa Gira Grant, a staff writer at the New Republic, explained on Intercepted. “I don’t think you get to have it both ways.<br>
<br>
[...]<br>
<br>
...Biden’s inability to admit fault — he has said, “I am not sorry for anything I have ever done” — simply shows that he is a byproduct of an institution of impunity. America, too, doesn’t do apologies. Reparations for black people and native people are nowhere in sight. We didn’t prosecute torture and we won’t prosecute war crimes. The cancer at the core of this nation is one of fundamental injustice, hidden beneath platitudes of freedom, liberty, and equality for all. To remove Biden would be to indict American exceptionalism itself.<br>
<br>
Liberals like Biden, who believe that America’s divisions can be healed by a new president, don’t see this country as built on exploitation. To understand how we heal, we have to view America through the painful lens of wrongs committed. Accountability must be viewed as a feminist issue, especially in a nation that wove oppression into every fiber of its flag.<br>
<br>
America should live in shame until we admit fault, recognize hurt, and ask for forgiveness. Joe Biden can go first.</blockquote>

I hope to god that Trump loses. The left has no future down the timeline where Trump gets re-elected. But what does accountability and justice look like for individuals and nations if Biden wins?

<em>For a change of pace instead of reaching though a victims past looking for lies, lets take a look at the accused?</em><br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/05/the-attacks-on-tara-reade-are-unbelievable-bullshit">This rundown</a> by Lyta Gold seems rather damning:
<blockquote>You know who’s not a very credible narrator? Joe Biden. His 1988 presidential campaign fell apart when it was revealed that he had plagiarized speeches by a British MP (including a line about being the first college graduate in his family “in a thousand generations” which wasn’t just plagiarism but a lie, since Biden “in fact did have relatives who attended college.”) His 1988 campaign was also damaged by the revelation that he had invented a number of fake academic accomplishments, such as graduating at the top of his class at Syracuse University College of Law (he finished 76th out of 85, and also plagiarized a law review paper when he was a student.) Since then, Biden has said on several occasions that he used to be a civil rights activist: “I was one of those guys that sat in and marched and all that stuff,” he said at a campaign event in 1987. But in the same year he also said, “I was not an activist. I worked at an all-black swimming pool in the east side of Wilmington, Delaware. I was involved in what they were thinking, what they were feeling. I was involved, but I was not out marching.” Biden has also claimed to have been arrested while protesting apartheid in South Africa, but this never, ever happened. He recently said he opposed the Iraq war from the start, a lie which CNN called him out on; he claimed in March that he opposed the bankruptcy bill, when he in fact wrote it! <br>
<br>
Biden has told more lies than I have the time or the stomach to recount. In Counterpunch, Bruce Levine has an excellent overview of Biden’s most egregious falsehoods. The most disturbing might be the one where Biden repeatedly claimed in public that his wife had been killed by a drunk driver who “drank his lunch instead of eating his lunch.” But this isn’t true at all—the driver, Curtis Dunn, was not at fault, and wasn’t drunk. The whole thing was just a horrible accident. Levine reports: “This falsehood of course deeply hurt Dunn. His family made many attempts to get Biden to correct it, and finally in 2009, after Curtis Dunn was dead, Biden called Dunn’s daughter to apologize.” (Incidentally, Biden is running for President in 2020 on a promise to restore “decency and honesty and character” to the White House.)</blockquote>

<em>Since it's getting a lot of favorites, could you share some details on &quot;terrible news&quot;? I think it's a pretty standard view that the introduction of a market economy is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the alleviation of poverty. E.g., Historical poverty reductions: more than a story about ‘free-market capitalism’. &quot;...globalization has been a key factor contributing to raising living standards across the world, its positive effects have been modulated by public policies, particularly social transfers.&quot; I don't know if we're disagreeing on substance (you think the economy should be controlled by government), or terminology (market economy as implemented in the Nordic countries, for example, or as envisioned by libertarian extremists).</em><br>
<br>
Check the article you cited:
<blockquote>Yes, over the last two centuries free markets and globalization have had a positive effect on aggregate economic growth, contributing to better living conditions and the reduction of extreme poverty across the world. Yet this is far from the only important socioeconomic change and moreover, the last two centuries have not been all about ‘free-market capitalism’. Governments around the world have dramatically increased their potential to collect revenues in order to redistribute resources through social transfers and raise the living standards of those that are worst off.</blockquote>

Market economies are incentivized to maximize profit, not quality of life or material equity. Now, that profit can be distributed in a way that does maximize quality of life and material equity, but only if the government can regulate the economy in that way.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, market economies also tend towards regulatory capture. Given enough time, the government will no longer be able to effectively redistribute those profits (see: America). This is why market economies eventually fail and erode the societies they are embedded in, even in places like Nordic countries.<br>
<br>
Also, market economies are built on a lie of infinite consumption and infinite growth literally fueled by carbon emissions. The devastation from climate change caused by The Market, particularly in third world countries, will wipe out any of the gains made thus far as a result of The Market.

<em>There are many studies that have shown that racism was a/the primary motivating factor in the shifts in 2016.</em><br>
<br>
Yes, I agree with you. But &quot;a/primary motivating factor&quot; is not the same thing as the race/gender essentialism initially posited above and that had kicked off this entire discussion.<br>
<br>
Also, it's not as clear cut as your summary of the cited study. In fact, that study makes it point to disaggregate between racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. Of course, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment are very closely related (just take a look at most of my life history in America), but as the cited study demonstrates, they are also not the same thing.<br>
<br>
For example, white working-class Democrat votes skyrocket so high in terms of relationship to switching to Trump for county level Latino population growth (on page 20) that it merits expanding the y-axis scale, However, the same voting group scores in the same ballpark as other white Democrat segments on racial attitudes. Meanwhile, it's the racial attitudes of non-working class whites that significantly outpaces those of working class whites in terms of vote-switching to Trump:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/BBRVdg1.png">https://i.imgur.com/BBRVdg1.png</a><br>
<br>
There is also a very compelling and useful appendix item (Appendix K, page 57) that discusses why racially conservative voters supported Obama in 2012:
<blockquote>There is evidence that racial attitudes have become more strongly associated with a variety of outcomes over time, including between 2012 and 2016. Enders and Scott (2018) show that correlations between racial resentment and party identification, ideology, presidential candidate thermometer ratings, voting, and attitudes towards health insurance and government services strengthened between 2012 and 2016. Using different data, Tesler (2016c) shows that racial attitudes mattered more in 2016 voting than in 2008 or 2012, helping explain why some racial conservatives were still supporting Obama in 2012. Indeed, Tesler (2016a) shows that fully a quarter of Whites who strongly opposed interracial dating still supported Obama in 2012. Finally, Sides (2017) finds that attitudes related to immigration, religion, and race were more salient to voter decision making in 2016 than in 2012 and that this pattern is not found for other attitudes.<br>
<br>
How could this be the case? First, we argue that race and immigration were more salient in 2016 than in 2012. President Trump was more explicitly racial in his appeals than any previous candidate, shifting norms around what sort of prejudiced beliefs and rhetoric is socially acceptable (Schaffner 2018). Similarly, Clinton moved to the left of Obama on a number of racerelated issues. As Gillon (2016) shows, Obama actually spoke less about race than other recent Democratic candidates.</blockquote>

That said, I find this article from the very Democrat-friendly American Prospect, which cites findings from <a href="https://prospect.org/power/prejudice.-economics.-both./">a pro-Clinton super-PAC</a>, to be persuasive in understanding what changed in 2016:
<blockquote>Polling and focus groups conducted last month by the pro-Clinton SuperPAC Priorities USA showed that Obama-Trump voters worried greatly about dropping standards of living, and felt that Democrats had become a party of the rich, disconnected from the needs of white working-class Americans. The drop-off voters who had voted for Obama in 2012 but failed to vote in 2016 were also deeply economically anxious, and while they have a strong distaste for Republicans and Trump, they often felt that Democrats would do little to improve their own situations.<br>
<br>
The Priorities USA study reflects the findings from other data. As pollster Stan Greenberg noted in this summer’s Prospect, Democratic support has declined not just with working-class whites, but also with the entire working-class coalition that once made up a crucial element of the Obama electorate. This disenchantment with Democratic economics is found in minority and millennial voters, for whom the economic “progress” much touted by both Obama and Clinton is more illusion than reality.<br>
<br>
The same 2016 National Election Study that showed high correlations of cultural anxiety with support for Trump also showed that Trump voters skewed lower in income than the supporters of previous GOP nominees. Correspondingly, the 2016 exit polls also revealed a cratering in lower-income voters’ support for Democrats: Those making under $50,000 per year shifted from Obama to Trump by 21 points, even as those making over $100,000 per year shifted from Romney to Clinton by 9 points.<br>
<br>
It's also important to note that most studies minimizing the effect of economic anxiety tend to use raw income as their objective correlative for anxiety. But this is a fundamental error: Downward mobility, high rates of opioid addiction, prevalence of subprime loans, lack of good jobs for younger generations, and the susceptibility of jobs to automation and outsourcing can all generate anxiety. Even where incomes are nominally in the middle class, those communities in most rapid economic decline were likeliest to be for Trump.</blockquote>

Your cited study does account for mobility, but I would have loved to see more investigation on things like high rates of opioid addiction and prevalence of subprime loans.<br>
<br>
It is well known that social attitudes shift over time. But saying &quot;they're just racist or sexist&quot; is not an adequate explanation for <em>why</em> these social attitudes shift. I'd love to see more research on that because I think it is critical in winning future elections and wresting control away from Republicans, especially in red states.<br>
<br>
Besides, if economic factors don't play any role at all in people's racial attitudes, why have white colonizers and slaveowners used them as a cudgel to foment racial prejudice for centuries across the world?

It's so bogglingly mundane that you may have accused me of 'essentialism' for saying the sky is blue - yes, everywhere on earth, even though there are indeed a wide variety of places on earth.</em><br>
<br>
If these biases are so completely deep-seated, permanent, and pervasive, how did Obama win twice? How did Clinton come so close to winning?<br>
<br>
The essentialism is saying this is the <strong><em>only</em></strong> reason millions of people voted the way they did because of their race and/or gender.<br>
<br>
<em>The problem with your question here is that it presupposes that the 2016 loss was the Democrats' fault and therefore they need to do something differently. Dude. The man boasted about committing crimes and still got elected, and you think the other party's &quot;mistakes&quot; (which you will only darkly hint at) are what caused the loss?! This is literally the &quot;But what was she wearing?&quot; of electoral losses. It's textbook misogyny. Ask not what the Democrats' should do differently. Ask what you can do to stop the white supremacists and misogynists.</em><br>
<br>
If the Democrats have absolutely no responsibility for their stunning loss in 2016, then what's the point of introspection, analysis, or discussion? Do they also have no responsibility for their victories in 2018? The comparison of this discussion to sexual assault is horrifyingly inappropriate, especially considering Biden's victory in the primary.<br>
<br>
Moreover, I'm not sure why you are putting quotes in &quot;mistakes&quot; since I never said that nor even hinted at it.

I'm not saying either of those things. I am trying to understand how a singular cause essentialized to one's race and/or gender can determine the voting patterns of millions of people. I'm generally pretty skeptical of essentialization, especially applied to so many different people.<br>
<br>
And then if that's actually the case, what should Democrats do in 2020 and beyond?

<em>I get the sense that you're trying to argue that people of color should have voted for a (nonexistent) non-racist third party instead, Ouverture. Are you? Or perhaps you're trying to suggest that people of color should have started a revolution maybe? I have no idea.</em><br>
<br>
I'm not arguing that at all.<br>
<br>
When presented with a white supremacist Democrat and a white supremacist Republican, I believe everyone should make the heartbreaking decision to vote for the white supremacist Democrat while working tirelessly the rest of the 4 years to build local, state, labor, and national power so we don't have to make those horrible decisions in the future. After all, that's what so many Sanders supporters did in 2016 and it has played a huge factor in shifting the Democrats and the country's electorate to the left on many issues.<br>
<br>
<em>I'm confused about that whole series of questions, because to me, it seems kind of obvious that people of color vote Democrat in spite of Democrats being racist af because people of color do not want Republicans to come to power because Republicans want to kill us even quicker.</em><br>
<br>
But as mentioned repeatedly, they <em>didn't</em> do that in 2016. Many voted for Clinton, but a critical number also stayed home or voted for Trump despite having voted for Obama twice in the previous 8 years. And this isn't the only paradox in how people have voted in recent years.<br>
<br>
&quot;That whole series of questions&quot;, just like the article in the FP, is to help understand why people vote the way they do and why parties end up the way they are. I'm not even interested in whether what the Democrats did is good or bad; in this particular conversation, I am far more interested in understanding why and when they were(n't) <em>successful</em>.<br>
<br>
Without building that understanding, Democrats will continue to face devastating losses up and down the ballot for the foreseeable future. They will give up on helping already marginalized people of color, women, and poor folks in red states. And I would much rather fight for power in a world where white supremacist Democrats are the most right-wing party in America instead of one where Republicans maintain permanent white majority rule.

<em>Instead of berating people for not agreeing that the DLC are just Republicans in different branding, it would be more productive to ask why they don't agree with that thesis - a number of us have pointed out why we don't agree with the argument. And no, saying that they're not the same doesn't serve as absolution for the sins of the DLC - all it's saying is that people see a difference between the groups, and that difference is what has driven these political shifts.</em><br>
<br>
I have never said these groups are the same, but that the DLC was explicitly making a play for the same voters. That was their entire mission.<br>
<br>
I am responding to an above argument that claims it is solely racism and misogyny (internalized and otherwise) that can definitively and conclusively explain changes in voting patterns in 2016. When a singular cause can so completely explain the behavior of millions of people, this borders on a form of essentializing science and that is when I start getting <em>really</em> interested in seeing the work.<br>
<br>
I would love to learn more about how this applies to prior elections and political shifts in the Democratic party, especially in light of the data in the FP article. And if this race/gender science perspective is really all that explains how to win elections, what should Biden and the Democrats do in 2020?<br>
<br>

I can't speak to how it would actually affect the election (nor do I think anyone here or elsewhere can), but if Trump and the GOP was able to make such a massive firestorm over something as minor as Clinton's email server (and to do so for years!), I would be very surprised if they weren't able to do the same or much, much worse with a <em>rape allegation</em> (and all the accounts and images of Biden making women and young girls uncomfortable).<br>
<br>
It doesn't matter that Trump has done worse. Hypocrisy has never stopped anyone from laying waste to another in a political campaign, especially when it's a conservative launching the attacks.

<a href="https://prospect.org/features/dlc/">Here is a useful (and very rosy) look into the Democratic Leadership Council</a>, for anyone who was curious about what their explicit mission:
<blockquote>Over the course of its 16-year history, the DLC has been consistent on its core principles: support for fiscal discipline, free trade, reinventing government along more free-market lines, a strong military, welfare reform, a tough-on-crime approach, and a generally pro-business outlook. The organization has tended to bounce around some on social issues, such as abortion and gay rights, which went almost unmentioned in DLC policy statements in the 1980s, and on race.<br>
<br>
At its founding, the DLC's chief emphasis was on reconnecting the Democratic Party to white working- and middle-class class voters, who, the DLCers feared, had been increasingly attracted by the Republican Party's social conservatism, especially among northern ethnics and southern Protestants. To the DLC of the 1980s, that meant a message that was less tilted toward minorities and welfare, less radical on social issues like abortion and gays, more pro-defense, and more conservative on economic issues--in other words, less liberal generally. The DLC thundered against the &quot;liberal fundamentalism&quot; of the party's base--unionists, blacks, feminists, Greens, and cause groups generally.</blockquote>

<em>Because you're assuming your conclusion. They were not, in fact, explicitly trying to be as racist, misogynistic, and homophobic as the Republicans. That isn't to say they weren't being all of those things but they were being less so. You're stating it as fact when it isn't.</em><br>
<br>
This <em>was</em> the entire mission of the New Democrats and the Democratic Leadership Council though. After over a decade in the Reaganite wilderness, the whole idea was to move the Democrats significantly to the right to compete for these votes.<br>
<br>
This is why, during the '92 campaign, Bill Clinton went back to Arkansas to personally oversee the execution of Ricky Ray Rector. It was why he started that '92 campaign at Stone Mountain, the birthplace of the second Ku Klux Klan. It was why we had the '94 Crime Bill, devastating cuts to welfare, and the Defense of Marriage Act during these years of &quot;liberal&quot; power.<br>
<br>
There were certainly plenty of Republicans who wanted to do much worse, but it wasn't the GOP that twisted Bill Clinton's arm into bombing a medicine factory in Sudan or deregulating securities.<br>
<br>
But let's say the essentialist worldview being put forth is truly the case here. Why did the New Democrats still retain reliable votes from people of color during these years? Was it just purely internalized racism?<br>
<br>
And then what happened in 2000? And 2004? And during all the elections during the Obama years where the Democrats lost so much political power across the ballot? Did the Republicans introduce something into the water to increase the internalized misogyny and racism of people of color and women?<br>
<br>
Does this essentialized worldview hold up during primaries? Did Obama beat Hillary Clinton in the 2008 primary because of internalized misogyny? Did Sanders outperform Clinton with younger voters in both primaries because of internalized anti-youthfulness? Did Clinton outperform Sanders with older voters because of internalized ageism?<br>
<br>
And more importantly, what is the path forward? Does it mean that Democrats need to compete with Trump in 2020 on being more racist and sexist in order to win the votes of these people of color and women who are so deeply, singularly poisoned by internalized prejudice in 2020? Should we expect more racist campaign ads like <a href="https://thegrio.com/2020/04/18/trump-racist-campaign-ad-gets-called-out-on-twitter/">this one from Biden</a>?<br>
<br>
<em>It takes emotional energy to keep fighting these constant battles towards progress. In America with ever three steps forward others who want to stop you will cause society to take two steps back. A lot of people who have been fighting are just plain exhausted from having to fight tooth and nail for a single inch in a lot of these places. Some may join, some may continue the fight, others may not. You can't blame people for not wanting to actively decide to push a rock up the hill for others. People can't keep grinding themselves emotionally to dust lest they be called comfortable about a situation they're not even proximally responsible for. It's unfair to them.</em><br>
<br>
But it seems to take no emotional energy to construct strawmen and punch left it seems. It seems to take no energy to simultaneously call the left an insignificant minority group while also laying the blame for all the electoral failures of the Democrats at our feet. Or provide endless excuses and defenses for a war criminal and/or rapist, as long as she or he has the right political affiliation.<br>
<br>
I have been an activist and an organizer my entire life because my life and the lives of my people are inherently political and have been under threat regardless of what political party is in power in America. If people need breaks, they should take them. But laying the blame at my feet won't change the history made by all these very problematic faves.

To restate: why did so many white voters leave the Democratic party in the 90s when the Democrats were explicitly trying to be as racist, misogynistic, and homophobic as the Republicans? The entire point of the New Democrats was to retain and expand this specific segment of voters.<br>
<br>
And conversely: why did so many people of color and women stay home or vote for Trump when the Democrats were explicitly trying to win over their votes? The entire point of the post-Obama coalition was to retain and expand these two segments of voters.<br>
<br>
How do racism and misogyny <em>completely</em> explain these two phenomena? What exactly changed in 8 years, during which Obama won two presidential elections and elevated countless talented women to various positions of power, for internalized racism and misogyny to completely transform the minds of millions of women and people of color?<br>

<em>That's literally all there is to it.</em><br>
<br>
Assuming the sole factors for tens of millions of American voters in 2016 can be definitively generalized to racism and misogyny, what does this say about all the women and people of color who voted for Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/11/11/trump-got-more-votes-from-people-of-color-than-romney-did-heres-the-data/">in greater percentages than they had previously voted for Romney</a>?<br>
<br>
Can their behavior really be completely explained so cleanly by internalized racism and misogyny? <br>
<br>
Or the people of color and young people who stayed home in record numbers? What changed between 2008 and 2016? If not voting at all was a vote for Trump, can we assign such essentialized causation to why young people and people of color didn't vote for a woman president? Is misogyny literally all there is is to it?<br>
<br>
As mentioned in the article, there is no path forward for Democrats in the Senate and in many local+state governments without working-class voters of all races, especially white voters in states where there simply aren't that many people of color. How useful is it to say &quot;oh, we will just have to accept losing vast amounts of political power because we know each and single one of these voters will forever going to remain irredeemably racist and sexist&quot;?<br>
<br>
There was a time not too long ago when Democrats campaigned on, among other things, explicitly white supremacist mass incarceration, police militarization, financial deregulation, destroying the welfare system, and the execution of an intellectually impaired black prisoner. Despite this, they continued to reliably win the votes of people of color while losing much of their white voter base. If racism explains the preferences of this particular white voting segment, why didn't they stay with these New Democrats?

I don't think the piece is being adequately grappled with here (beyond the initial reflex of ctrl'f for &quot;race&quot; and not finding it) and it's a shame because it is pretty distinctive from what usually passes for mainstream political analysis in American politics:
<blockquote>The fact that Sanders boasts more support among suburban college graduates than whites with low levels of education shouldn’t be surprising. His agenda may have more to offer the latter in material terms. But in the contemporary U.S., college-educated whites tend to evince more progressive policy preferences than non-college-educated ones even on matters of redistribution. In a national survey fielded earlier this month, the progressive think tank Data for Progress asked voters, “Do you think it is the responsibility of the federal government to see to it that everyone has health-care coverage?” College-educated white voters said “yes” by a margin of 50 to 39 percent; among non-college-educated white voters, that margin was 43 to 39 percent.<br>
<br>
The results of Maine’s 2017 referendum on Medicaid expansion lend credence to this finding. Given the opportunity to expand the availability of socialized health insurance, the most highly educated parts of the Pine Tree State voted in favor, while the least well-educated regions voted against. Material interests weren’t entirely irrelevant to voting patterns: Researchers found that, if one held education constant, then areas with higher incomes were more likely to oppose Medicaid expansion. But an area’s median income was still a less reliable predictor of its support for the policy than its average level of educational attainment; college trumped class.<br>
<br>
This same dynamic is reflected in the ideological tendencies of the Democratic Party’s congressional caucus. Democratic House members who represent districts with above-median levels of college-educated white voters are more likely to belong to the Progressive Caucus — and to co-sponsor Medicare for All — than those who represent districts with above-median levels of non-college-educated white voters.</blockquote>

Trump secured over <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Pivot_Counties:_The_counties_that_voted_Obama-Obama-Trump_from_2008-2016">a half million votes</a> in places that voted for Obama <strong>twice</strong>. To breezily reduce this to a unitary question of racial animus not only absolves Democrats of answering hard questions about what changed in 4 and 8 years when they were in power, but also makes it all the harder to build political power with the electoral college, the Senate, and at local+state levels.<br>
<br>
Also:
<blockquote>But Eckland and Weiner believed that novel circumstances were more likely to hasten the erosion of class-based voting. All else equal, going to college made Americans more left wing, especially (though not exclusively) on questions of morality and cultural identity. And since a growing number of Americans, from a diversifying array of socioeconomic backgrounds, were poised to attend college in the coming decades, education-based political divisions were likely to grow in salience over time, while class-based ones diminished. As the researchers wrote:
<blockquote><em>Between 1940 and 1960 the proportion of all 18-21 year-olds enrolled in college more than doubled. Even if this trend does not continue and the figures stabilize, the average educational level of the adult population nevertheless will continue to rise for at least the next 4 or 5 decades, just as it has for the past several decades. This opens up the possibility that higher education is strongly implicated in the decline of class politics.</em></blockquote>

Four decades later, that “possibility” has grown to resemble a proven fact.</blockquote>

<em>Social issues are material interests. There is no divorcing the two.</em><br>
<br>
Partisan social issues or signaling like &quot;rolling coal&quot; or anti-trans rights certainly have material implications for oppressed people, but for a reactionary white person without a college degree, these social issues aren't material to their life. The number of gay people they see on TV won't directly impact their socioeconomic position.<br>

<em>The article misses the point from the very lede - namely that these voters are very much voting their class interest. A non-college educated white man voting for a candidate who, either tacitly or openly, pushes for support of white supremacy is voting for someone who is supporting their class interest, because race and class are interconnected.</em><br>
<br>
Race and class are indeed deeply interconnected thanks to centuries of white supremacy coupled tightly with capitalism, but a GOP tax cut that benefits billionaires or guts healthcare does little to benefit white men without college degrees.<br>
<br>
But just as working-class people of color reliably vote for white supremacist Democrats who don't represent their material interests, these working-class white men still reliably vote for Republicans who don't represent their material interests because the other side is seen as worse, especially on social issues that aren't directly relevant to their material interests.

<a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/im-a-political-scientist-this-is-why-climate-activists-1843130270">I'm a Political Scientist. This Is Why Climate Activists Need to Keep Turning the Heat Up on Joe Biden</a> (Earther):
<blockquote>Zooming out to the broader context provides additional reasons for the climate justice movement to stay laser-focused on pressuring the political system, from the Biden campaign to Democrats in Congress. Recovery from the coronavirus pandemic will be a defining feature of politics in the coming months and even years. It has created a critical juncture where we can either implement policies that exacerbate the unequal, fossil-fueled, and economically precarious status quo, or lay the groundwork for a fairer and lower carbon economy for all.<br>
<br>
Activists should aim to both expand the bench of Green New Deal advocates at all levels of public office and be prepared to hold Democrats accountable as part of a dynamic, multifaceted political strategy. Specifically, in regards to Biden, they should demand that he cut all financial and advising relationships with the fossil fuel industry; increase his proposed public investment on climate by a factor of ten; center job-creation for working class and racialized communities; and populate his transition team with policymakers committed to these goals.<br>
<br>
And there’s reason to be cautiously hopeful about the impact of such a strategy. The fossil fuel sector is in free fall, with demand and prices plummeting. That means a key opponent to climate action is in a weaker position, economically and politically. In addition, the public is deeply concerned about their economic security now and in the future, which would likely increase political support for job-centric public investment. And, there are ideas lying around, such as the Green Stimulus approach that I and 10 other policy experts co-authored.<br>
<br>
In other words, the moment is ripe for a Green New Deal. It would behoove activists to keep the pressure on.</blockquote>

<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/157459/dont-let-larry-summers-block-climate-progress">Don’t Let Larry Summers Block Climate Progress Again</a> (The New Republic):
<blockquote>There are many reasons the average news reader might not like Larry Summers. A longtime friend of convicted predator Jeffrey Epstein, Summers deregulated the banking sector as Bill Clinton’s Treasury Secretary, helping to set the stage for the 2008 financial crisis. While serving as chief economist of the World Bank, he put his name to a memo suggesting industries dump toxic waste in Africa because it was “underpolluted,” later claiming the memo was intended as “sardonic counterpoint.” In 2005, while president of Harvard University, he posited that women’s brains weren’t well suited for math and science.<br>
<br>
Summers’s tenure in the Obama administration featured a number of questionable choices. As the incoming head of Obama’s National Economic Council in 2008, Summers famously misled the president-elect about the size of the stimulus package that leading experts—including fellow transition team member Christina Romer—urged was necessary, and kept him from even seeing the trillion-plus-dollar figures they recommended to avert skyrocketing unemployment. The recession was more painful and prolonged as a result. As reported by another transition team member, Reed Hundt, in A Crisis Wasted, he also specifically shot down several proposals from elsewhere in the inner circle about how the recovery should look.<br>
<br>
As during the Clinton administration, Summers was leery of moving too quickly to curb carbon emissions, urging a lenient timetable for polluters; any real reforms, he reasoned, would have to wait for legislation. Hundt also writes that Summers rejected his proposal to have Obama’s stimulus create a green investment bank and build energy efficiency infrastructure and high-voltage transmission lines. This Green Recovery and Investment Program, or GRIP, as it was known, would have been more extensive than the roughly 10 percent of the stimulus eventually spent on clean energy. Summers thought it would create too much debt. He rejected the concept of creating new institutions, preferring a strategy of spending as quickly as possible, and saw the sole goal of the recovery as boosting demand and gross domestic product with a quick injection of federal cash. Staring down the barrel of double-digit unemployment in December 2008, Summers said, “Our economic problem is that the country has too much debt.”</blockquote>

Here's hoping the center does not hold.

<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/157372/right-way-push-biden-left">The Right Way to Push Biden to the Left</a>:
<blockquote>Most presidential nominees leave the primary season behind with a sprint to the political center. It’s a testament to the power progressives have built within the Democratic Party since 2016 that Joe Biden is instead being urged to make a showy detour to the left. There is no chance whatsoever that Biden will campaign on Medicare for All or many of the other policies that were cornerstones of Bernie Sanders’s campaign. And for all progressives know, his commitment even to the proposals his camp has billed as overtures to the left, including a means-tested free college plan and lowering the Medicare age to 60, may not last through November. But left-leaning activists and policy minds are trying to catch Biden’s ear on everything from climate policy to the veepstakes anyway, hoping to leverage the Democratic establishment’s anxieties about uniting the party into sustained influence on the Biden campaign and the potential administration to come.<br>
<br>
But even if they make these gains, all of that influence will be useless unless Biden commits himself to a set of structural reforms: four pillars upon which the success of his presidency, the security of any policy gains he makes, and the political future of the Democratic Party may depend. This is where the conversations about Biden winning over progressives should begin. If he refuses to make these commitments, this is also where those conversations should end.</blockquote>

<em>I'm not sure where the disconnect is here, because &quot;play the game&quot; in the US political system carries with it the obvious proviso that you're playing on the enemy's field, under the enemy's rule, with the enemy's refs. Who is not aware of this by now? There's nothing condescending about pointing that out when so many of the responses boil down to &quot;why are the Democrats putting politics in politics?&quot; Political parties set their own parameters, and can wield enormous influence over outcomes, as you correctly note with your links.</em><br>
<br>
I mean, this is exactly how I see the leftists in orientation to the neoconservative and neoliberal arms of the Democratic party (I don't think the people I want to haul in front of the Hague would really consider me their friends), but the thread had seemed to go in the direction of coalitions between liberals and leftists.<br>
<br>
Although if you are painting the establishmnetDemocratic party as such a hostile force and assuming we must be as <em>pragmatic</em> and <em>utilitarian</em> as possible, then it seems the most optimal solution is for leftists to accelerate the collapse and irrelevance of the Democratic party, both from the outside and the inside.<br>
<br>
I don't believe in accelerationism, but based on the above, wouldn't that be more effective than a grueling campaign of trench warfare on the enemy's field, under the enemy's rule, with the enemy's refs?<br>
 <br>
<em>My point in citing the Jacobin piece was that in a discussion about electoral strategy for Democrats running to the center vs. to the left, we need to understand what running to the left means. If it means being more like AOC, then sign me the fuck up. Still, the mindset that led a very prominent socialist publication to give a platform to someone whitewashing the views of a neo-Nazi Trumper didn't come from nowhere, and I'll be happy to cite more examples of anti-anti-Trumpism bordering on pro-Trumpism among prominent leftists if you'd like me to, but maybe we can just use this very thread as evidence that &quot;the Democrats are the real problem&quot; isn't exactly a minority viewpoint?</em><br>
<br>
There are far better and more productive ways to talk to a leftist person of color than cryptically associating them with a neo-Nazi.

<em>Both Clinton and Obama benefited enormously from <strong>the disastrous economies their Republican predecessors created</strong>. Their platforms and messaging were essentially centrist. Clinton campaigned on triangulation, and Obama on uniting the country.</em><br>
<br>
One of the biggest drivers of both the 2008 commodities crisis and the 2008 global recession was the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. Another significant driver behind the 2008 global recession was the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act.<br>
<br>
A key architect for both pieces of legislation? Larry Summers.<br>
<br>
The president who signed both pieces of legislation in, along with many other deregulatory mechanisms? Bill Clinton, who also empowered Robert Rubin and, of all people, Alan Greenspan.<br>
<br>
This <a href="https://archives.cjr.org/the_audit/bill_clinton_the_republicans_m.php">rewriting of history</a> would be funny if we weren't still living in the wreckage of Clinton's actions.<br>
<br>
Obama may have &quot;benefited enormously&quot; if one just narrowly looks at the ascendance of a single politician to presidential office as a success metric, but people of color, poor people, and the Democratic party as a whole has suffered immeasurably as a result, especially considering the 2008 recession helped Trump win in 2016.

For all the condescending lecturing about how the left just needs to &quot;play the game&quot;, it is truly remarkable to see how quickly people forget about how the game has actually been played in very recent memory.<br>
<br>
<em>Now, this is just one writer on Jacobin, and of course Jacobin isn't the entirety of leftism. Still, a prominent socialist publication doesn't just let any asshole write for them, and it's not like working backwards from &quot;liberals are the ones preventing real change from happening&quot; is an underrepresented viewpoint. I don't know how someone on the nominal left gets so desperate for material to attack Democrats that they start mining Trumpist rallies for talking points, but no matter how much you dress your article up with caveats about how you agree with what Whitmer did in Michigan and don't like the protestors, you can't be using a neo-Nazi to own the libs. As it was well put above, &quot;the ideology that made that isn't something I'm ever going to ride with.&quot;</em><br>
<br>
This is such a strange tangent, but it is telling that when I talk about the laundry list of economic disasters and war crimes, with body counts in the millions and suffering in the billions, caused by actual leaders of the Democratic party, the only response here is to talk about the bizarre one-off opinion of a single Jacobin writer I have never heard of. All of a sudden, this random person transforms into the vanguard of the left.<br>
<br>
A lone Neo-Nazi idiot I have never heard of is easy to deal with; hell, the cops in the liberal bastions of NYC and LA scare me a lot more than &quot;Christian Yingling&quot; does.<br>
<br>
You know what really scares me? Another Democratic administration continuing their obsession with bipartisan collaboration with neoconservatives and fascists wielding actual power in places like Saudi Arabia and Israel.<br>

<em>Which Democrats have won the Presidency in the past 50 years? Candidates with intense charisma (JFK, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama), one who stepped in when his predecessor was assassinated (LBJ) and didn't run for a second term of his own, and one who benefited from the Nixon disgust/backlash (Carter) but couldn't even get reelected. None of this makes a case for either centrist or leftist policy.</em><br>
<br>
Yes, I agree with this analysis. So for me, when liberal politicians back white supremacist and anti-poor policies, they do it because that's their actual preference (or the preferences of their vampire squid donor pool), not because of some excuse about electability.

<em>Clinton moved to the right, won the election. Obama moved to the center, won the election.</em> <br>
<br>
It's fascinating to see what is omitted in this conveniently terse and clinical retelling of the last three decades in American third way liberalism. Namely, what groups paid what price for Clinton and Obama's &quot;moves to the right&quot;.<br>
<br>
And then, just how little gains both Clinton and Obama made from these supposedly utilitarian decisions. Moreover, the third way planted many of the seeds that led to both the Tea Party and Donald Trump.<br>
<br>
The Democratic Pary hasn't listened to the left in these past three decades. You make it clear you don't care about poor people or people of color and that is certainly your prerogative, but if you say you do care about &quot;winning elections&quot;, how can you look at <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/10/14211994/obama-democrats-downballot">the rot and the collapse of the Democratic Party up and down the ballot</a> and think &quot;this is fine&quot;?

Reading through The Atlantic article about Summers really takes me back to some of the darkest chapters of modern American liberalism:
<blockquote>Summers helped midwife a major series of policy errors dating back 20 years that led directly to what many economists now believe was the worst financial crisis ever. In particular, Summers's opponents—he faces a phalanx of opposition among Democrats on the Hill—point to the Commodities Futures Modernization Act of 2000, which effectively deregulated the global market in over-the-counter derivatives and was Summers's signal achievement as Treasury secretary. The final report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission convened by Congress in 2009 puts the government's failure to rein in these derivatives at &quot;the center of the storm.&quot;</blockquote>

In terms of years of life lost from both the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/the-real-hunger-games-how-banks-gamble-on-food-prices-and-the-poor-lose-out-7606263.html">2008 commodity futures crisis</a> and 2008 global recession, Summers was a key architect of two of the most horrifying acts of white supremacy and mass suffering in the last <em>century</em>.<br>
<br>
Speaking of utilitarianism and winning elections, how did all those compromises help the Democrats up and down the ballot in 2010? 2012? 2014? 2016?<br>
<br>
Because what I see here is Summers having played a significant role in the economic devastation that contributed to the up and downballot collapse of the Democratic party.<br>
<br>
So if liberals and centrists want to win elections, why exactly is Biden going back to this tainted and incompetent well for advice?<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
One depressing final note from the Atlantic piece. My jaw dropped a little when I saw the name of Larry Summers's final defender:
<blockquote>And it is what Summers's defenders are saying about him now as a prospective Fed chief. &quot;We're now talking about the 58-year-old Larry, not the 30-year-old Larry,&quot; fellow Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff told me this week. </blockquote>

<em>Rogoff</em>?<br>
<br>
It's a shame the Atlantic piece didn't mention the <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/127095/Austerity-Bites-especially-if-you-cant-Math">infamous Reinhart-Rogoff error</a>, which just like Summers, has contributed immense amounts of suffering by poor people and people of color in America and across the world.

<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/09/the-comprehensive-case-against-larry-summers/279651/">For those who are curious about Larry Summers</a>:
<blockquote>But, according to numerous accounts from those who have worked with him, Summers has often displayed the opposite attributes during his long career. Behind the scenes, he has used his power, combined with intellectual arrogance, to bully opponents into silence, even when they have been proved right. He has refused to allow his dissenters a voice at the table and adopted a policy of never admitting errors. <br>
<br>
And Summers has made a lot of errors in the past 20 years, despite the eminence of his research. As a government official, he helped author a series of ultimately disastrous or wrongheaded policies, from his big deregulatory moves as a Clinton administration apparatchik to his too-tepid response to the Great Recession as Obama's chief economic adviser. Summers pushed a stimulus that was too meek, and, along with his chief ally, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, he helped to ensure that millions of desperate mortgage-holders would stay underwater by failing to support a &quot;cramdown&quot; that would have allowed federal bankruptcy judges to have banks reduce mortgage balances, cut interest rates, and lengthen the terms of loans. At the same time, he supported every bailout of financial firms. All of this has left the economy still in the doldrums, five years after Lehman Brothers' 2008 collapse, and hurt the middle class. Yet in no instance has Summers ever been known to publicly acknowledge a mistake.</blockquote>

In fact, I am surprised Trump didn't pick Summers given their similarities in personality and ideology.

<em>Just a Data point: Bangladesh, while very poor and having a carbon footprint not even 1/16 that of the US, is still a nation of a 160 million people and 97% of its energy is derived by fossil fuels (over 56% of its electricity is generated by natural gas) and like almost every quickly developing nation is following the identical carbon emission curve as developed nations did 100 years before it. So that’s not “nothing.”<br>
</em><br>
The subsistence fishermen and farmers who live by the Bay of Bengal will face the worst impacts of climate change soonest and they literally contribute nothing in terms of carbon emissions.<br>
<br>
As for the rest of your comment about Bangladesh, splitpeasoup's comment covers my most immediate reaction.<br>
<br>
Still, I think it is important to quantify what we are talking about here. The relatively tiny amount of emissions that do come from Bangladesh (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions">0.08 Gt</a> in 2017) occurs because it is an extremely poor country with no other choices.<br>
<br>
What about America, with <strong>63 times</strong> the emissions?<br>
<br>
Additionally, where the West, namely America, goes has a huge impact on where China, India, and everyone else goes and can even go.<br>
<br>
<em>Ouverture, I asked for my comment to be deleted because of privacy concerns, but I do want to address what you're bringing up. I know the wide-ranging catastrophes brought about by climate change are very real. I am deeply frustrated with a phenomenon I've seen in self-described, largely white leftist media spaces, where the people who are talking the most about climate change in the apocalyptic, passive terms of &quot;The Collapse&quot; are UMC white men who seem to be obsessed with climate chaos as an aesthetic experience, not something to take concrete action against, not something real that affects real people, who are using the current global south casualties as a way to entertain eco-fascist, genocidal &quot;we have to accept that a lot of people will die&quot; discussions under the guise of ecological concerns, and/or engage in fear-mongering about the &quot;poor, brown&quot; people you're talking about becoming violent.

<em>It's clear that the US is in a massive free fall right now, but the cult of the collapse is selfish, self-indulgent, self-destructive, classist horseshit.</em><br>
<br>
The author of the piece in the original link, like myself, is Bangladeshi and I guarantee you the collapse is real and happening <strong>right now</strong> (Metafilter even discussed it! <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/160448/Thirty-Million-a-film-about-Bangladesh-and-climate-change">4 years ago</a>!). Bangladesh is an incredibly poor country that has contributed literally nothing to climate change, but our people have already suffered greatly as a result of it and will only suffer so much worse in the coming decades.<br>
<br>
Sure, the collapse has not yet come for wealthy Brooklynites who, like Westerners in general (and Americans in particular), only accelerate the timeline and savagery of climate change's impacts every day. But if we're talking about New York and American lives, storms with the intensity of Hurricane Sandy will occur <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/hurricane-sandy-size-floods-up-to-17-times-more-likely-by-2100">seventeen times more often</a> by the end of the century. Katrina? <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/hurricanes-and-climate-change">Twice as often</a>.<br>
<br>
I strongly believe in deep adaptation combined with a global green new deal that rapidly decarbonizes the global economy and shifts to the mass research and production of negative emissions technology. These things require mass action and solidarity and I absolutely loathe the idea of people, especially Westerners, doing nothing in the face of this cataclysm while their entire lives have fueled the worst of it.<br>
<br>
I apologize if I'm misreading your comment, but this isn't some sort of cult. The collapse is real and killing lots of people right now and displacing countless more. They just happen to be poor, brown, and not &quot;blue check, arts and media left twitter&quot; users.

It is striking to see all this prose describing imperialist states as failed or failing states.<br>

After all, the devastation America faces as a result of COVID-19 is just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point">a basis point</a> of what it militarily wrought in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen. It is also a blip compared to what America economically wrought across the world with the 2007 commodity futures crisis and the 2008 financial crisis. And these disasters are from just the past two decades; if I didn't limit the timeframe, this post would be much, much longer.<br>
<br>
It is all the more striking, given the underlying conditions that weakened America existed long before Trump. These conditions are not bugs, but instead intended features of a crumbling and hollowed out imperialist and kleptocratic hegemony. They represent the most significant legacies of bipartisan collaboration in American politics.<br>
<br>
America has been on the precipice for a long time; Trump just happened to be the incompetent, cruel fascist to dropkick the whole thing off the precipice.<br>
<br>
And it is all the more tragic because once again, the people who face the worst impacts of these decisions made by the extremely powerful will be those already marginalized by age, race, immigration status, nationality, and class.

<em>If present circumstances aren't an obvious &quot;hang together or hang separately&quot; moment for all of us -- a moment where we can zoom out a bit on tactical disagreements and focus on areas of agreement instead of points on which we might differ -- then there is no amount of participation in the two-party system that can be deemed acceptable to the radical faction, and thus no significant role for leftism in national electoral politics. To me, that would be a huge mistake given how many Sanders-aligned progressives have shown how much can be accomplished from inside the machine.<br>

<br>
You misunderstand. I can work with liberals/centrists who defend and apologize for war criminals and rapists, but they will never be my comrades.<br>

<em>Latest Biden ad appears to be an attempt to compete on anti-China sentiment with Trump which a) isn’t going to work and b) racism? Really? That’s all you’ve got?</em><br>
<br>
Democrats pivoting to the right in the general election will always require throwing different groups of marginalized people under the bus. I wonder just what kind of concessions Biden will make on abortion and LGBTQ rights in order to secure &quot;moderate&quot; Republican votes.<br>
<br>
<em>Like many MeFi political threads, there are a lot of overlapping conversations in here with varying degrees of rancor and tribal bickering. If you choose to focus on the worst examples of in-fighting to the exclusion of other aspects of the thread that are more indicative of a desire to understand the other side's point of view and repair broken lines of communication, then I can see why you might come away with this as &quot;the only message&quot;, but I see a lot more going on here that makes it worth looking past some of the nastier and more divisive comments, which seem to be coming in roughly equal measure from both factions.</em><br>
<br>
It's fascinating hearing this after months of commentary about how people would have supported Sanders if it wasn't for the rancor and nasty comments from a tiny section of the left.<br>
<br>
And I don't think this can be considered in-fighting. In-fighting assumes a shared worldview, ideology, and most importantly, solidarity. In-fighting is something that happens between comrades.<br>
<br>
In any case, I am looking forward to Biden's concessions to Sanders and Warren. That's the only hope this planet has left.

Yeah, Chomsky does this every 4 years. And maybe it's a surprise to those who aren't leftists, but he's not exactly a central authority of leftist thought.<br>

<em>Hmm, so would you say the opposite works then? You trust Sanders because he is not part of the liberal/centralist legacy, even on stances that separate him from other leftists/progressives?<br>

I don't completely trust Sanders either, in part because of what you mentioned. But I also don't worry at night that he will appoint Henry Kissinger or Eric Holder to his cabinet.<br>

<em>I've noticed that when Joe Biden says something with which people on the left disagree strongly they tend to take him at his word. But when he says something that you would assume they should greet positively like adopting some aspects of more progressive policies as a way to court progressive voters many on the left will say they don't believe him because he's a liar. Have you noticed that?</em><br>
<br>
This seems consistent for me. I can't speak for other leftists, but I don't trust Biden when it comes to anything involving progressive policies because of all the black, brown, and Muslim blood on his hands and his lack of accountability for the dark parts of his liberal/centrist legacy. Similarly, I take him at his word on the right-wing/centrist stuff because that is <em>fundamentally who he is</em>. That's been his campaign's entire argument for his electability.<br>
<br>
I don't put much stock in this idea of &quot;mouth sounds&quot; or whatever. During the 2016 campaign, Trump apologists said the same thing about every terrible thing he said (&quot;he doesn't actually mean it! it's just to get elected!&quot;) and then it turns out he went and did all those terrible things.<br>

<em>To all the newcomers to politics, Biden's gesture is called &quot;the pivot&quot; (to the center) because the election is nationwide and there are many who are on the fence. Some may recall that Clinton had a few Republicans in his cabinet, not counting the generals/admirals who rarely identify.</em><br>
<br>
Don't worry, as someone who isn't a newcomer to politics, I am well aware of the pivot to the right. So much so, that I would point out that &quot;the pivot&quot; has done very little to prevent <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/10/14211994/obama-democrats-downballot">the staggering down-ballot collapse for Democrats in the past decade</a>.<br>
<br>
<em>A strategist typically looks at say, white women who voted for Trump (over half of them did), and Hispanics, where one-third identify as Republican, and the 10% of African-Americans who identify as Republican, and the Southerners who were from long-time family Democrats before the 1970's. Then there are always white males who are disaffected with Trump but grew up learning to hate Democrats from the barn radio that brainwashed them.</em><br>
<br>
As Chuck Schumer once famously said in 2016: &quot;For every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't think throwing in a couple GOP war criminals or Goldman Sachs alumni (I can't tell which one is worse) is going to actually appeal to the voters Democrats so desperately need this year.

<em>More informed commentary welcome, but my impression is that the aggregate economic consequences of climate change are likely to be moderate. But the human consequences could very well be catastrophic because they will be neither aggregate (they will fall far more on poor Bangledeshi farmers than accountants in Toronto) nor mostly economic.</em><br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
<em>I mean, it certainly demonstrates the cost of doing nothing and makes it clear that mitigating climate change can be net beneficial to the world economy (contra Republican talking points). But I had always imagined it as a global-economy-crushing event.</em><br>
<br>
At 3 degrees of warming, climate change's economic consequences alone are massive. At $792 trillion, climate change would cost us <strong>ten times</strong> the gross world product we have today. Worse yet, every degree of warming GDP growth by 1%. This is the very definition of global-economy-crushing.<br>
<br>
Inundation, severe weather events, and just regular ol' hot weather will lead to tens (if not hundreds) of millions of climate refugees in just the next 30 years; the American locations impacted by inundation alone will drown places like New York City, most of Florida, and Los Angeles. Wildfires, dramatically increased in both frequency and intensity, will smother Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area in choking ash and smoke.<br>
<br>
Those are three of the largest and most significant economic centers in not just America, but the world. The economic consequences shouldn't be understated.<br>
<br>
Even for Toronto accountants, they will deal with increasingly more severe polar vortices (vortexes?) due to global warming's malformation of the polar jet stream. At 3 degrees of warming, staple crop yields fall at least 30%. And even accountants have to eat~<br>
<br>
Climate change will (and already has) hit Bangladeshi farmers hardest, but wealth and privilege will only somewhat delay the inevitable.<br>
<br>
And like both of you said, we're not even talking about the massive human consequences.

<em>Biden is in many ways a weak person, he has flaws. Not as many flaws as Trump, but some serious flaws. There are good reasons he never made it to the top candidate before now. But he is undoubtably a patriot, someone who wants to do right, and someone with decades of experience in politics. He can rebuild government and the rule of law in America, and those are the most important tasks right now. The people who back him and who will be in the administration are the best people for real, not a trumpian hoax.

Let's not forget he has the blood of millions of Iraqis on his hands and was VP while Obama built up the deportation and drone strike/SOCOM war crime machinery that Trump then ramped up to even worse levels.<br>

<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/157302/joe-biden-bernie-sanders-dsa-endorsement">Don’t Fear the Anti-Biden Socialist</a>:
<blockquote>But a national survey of 18-24-year-olds fielded by the Knight Foundation and released in February found that while 37 percent of those without religious objections to voting offered cynicism, disinterest, or dissatisfaction with political candidates as reasons for staying home, almost as many—31 percent—cited logistical constraints like being unregistered, or lacking the free time to vote. <strong>When asked what would motivate them more to vote, only 20 percent of the young people surveyed said a good candidate or a stance on a particular issue would make a difference, while 38 percent cited changes to their lives or policy that would make it easier to vote, including having more time to vote and the ability to vote online.</strong><br>
<br>
All of this comports with Census data about voting and registration over the past several elections, which unsurprisingly shows that voters past retirement age, unlike young voters, are exceptionally unlikely to cite being busy as a reason for not having voted. Stability of residence also works in older voters’ favor—young people move much more, which can complicate registration and turnout on election day. It should be said that for all the talk about the youth sitting out, voters under 30 were the only age category that saw their turnout increase in 2016, albeit just slightly, from 45 percent to just over 46 percent. Turnout from voters over 65 dipped from 72 percent to about 71 percent. The gap, of course, remains extraordinary—so large, in fact, that it should be clear older voters would dominate the electorate even if youth turnout improved considerably, which doesn’t seem likely anytime soon.<br>
<br>
[...]<br>
<br>
The conversations about the concessions Biden might make to win them over has focused on his stances on issues like healthcare and climate change. But if Biden wants progressive votes, he should also pledge to make those votes matter more by endorsing the effort to eliminate the Electoral College by interstate compact. He should also renounce his support for the Senate filibuster, which grants the most conservative parts of the country veto power over policies most Americans support and will make much of the agenda he’s urging people to the polls for impossible. It’s not obvious that Biden will take suggestions like this seriously and he ultimately doesn’t have to—the election isn’t going to rest on committed progressives, and it seems clear that Biden believes being president is the only truly critical item on his presidential platform.<br>
<br>
Those who find this dispiriting should assuage their disappointment with how the Democratic primary turned out by involving themselves in other political efforts. Engage with a race somewhere down-ballot. Organize a workplace or an apartment complex. Plan a run for office yourself or, alternatively, a demonstration that might bring people to the streets whenever the coronavirus crisis passes. Even when they fail, these and other forms of political activity can be much more influential and consequential than whatever you do in the privacy of a voting booth.</blockquote>

One thing that has really struck me about people's reactions to this allegation is, other than in anti-colonial spaces, how much more weight direct individual violence is given compared to systemic proximal violence.<br>
<br>
After all, we don't have to allege, wonder, or debate if Biden was a cheerleader for the Iraq War, a devastating and immoral action that has definitively harmed millions of people.<br>
<br>
But for whatever reason, that much horror and sorrow inflicted on millions of people mean very little compared to the allegation of one person being discussed here.<br>
<br>
How do people reconcile this disparity? Is it because the victim here is a white American woman with a name while the victims of the Iraq war are brown, far away, and nameless?<br>

Is it like the deep personal moral differences that arise from how one thinks about the trolley problem?

From the NYT article about the reporting...this is a little unreal:
<blockquote><strong>I want to ask about some edits that were made after publication, the deletion of the second half of the sentence: “The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden, beyond the hugs, kisses and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable.” Why did you do that?<br>
</strong><br>
Even though a lot of us, including me, had looked at it before the story went into the paper, I think that the campaign thought that the phrasing was awkward and made it look like there were other instances in which he had been accused of sexual misconduct.

This is like saying &quot;class, not race&quot; except it's &quot;class, not age&quot;. It is both class <strong>and</strong> age (and race and gender and immigration status and everything else as well).<br>
<br>
It is true that due to capitalism's stranglehold on humanity, the 1% will do well regardless of generation, but as the article highlights, there are very real generational distinctions when controlling for socioeconomic status, starting from before people are even born (and those prenatal effects will stay with them throughout their <strong>entire lives</strong>):
<blockquote>Americans born during this calamity will be more likely to have low birth weights and to be in poor health generally, with lifelong effects. Children will not just endure this trauma—manifested in lost months of schooling, skipped meals, housing volatility, and increased abuse—but will carry it with them. Zoomers graduating into the recession will die sooner because of it, suffering increased incidence of heart disease, lung cancer, liver disease, and drug overdoses in the coming decades; they will also earn less over the course of their lives.</blockquote>

<em>Yeah, given the choice between Democratic foreign policy and Trump I'm not exactly breaking a sweat figuring out which to choose. And &quot;because domestic politics would change somewhat with a Biden presidency&quot; has to be in the running for the understatement of the year award.</em><br>
<br>
My point is that the reason Western liberals and centrists are not &quot;breaking a sweat&quot; is that white supremacy and imperialism in American foreign policy are so endemic, bipartisan, and ambient that their horrifying consequences are constantly minimized and excused even on Metafilter.<br>
<br>
And that is heartbreaking and frustrating to see, especially considering foreign policy is one of the few areas where the president has significant power over. This was one of the reasons I was so excited for a Sanders presidency and so worried about a Biden presidency.<br>

Trump must absolutely be defeated, but if Biden wins, nothing has me feeling hopeful that, after the inauguration, liberals and centrists will actually care to stop the great imperialist war machine that devours brown bodies for Western power. The past two D<br>

<em>Tell it to the kids in cages.</em><br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-build-cages-immigrants/">As discussed earlier</a>, America's white supremacist immigration policy was expanded under the Obama administration. This is not quite the slam dunk as I think any of us wish it was.<br>
<br>
That same administration sent back Honduran refugee children fleeing the very same violence the administration precipitated. It was such an act of staggering cruelty and white supremacy that I imagine many people here would think it happened under Trump.<br>
<br>
As a queer brown immigrant living in America (and whose family is spread out across the Middle East and Asia), I think I have more literal skin in the game than most people who discuss American politics. I am fully aware of how bad things are under Trump.<br>
<br>
But what concerns me is just how many Americans aren't aware of how bad things already <strong>were</strong> before Trump.<br>
<br>
<em>I share your disgust with U.S. foreign policy history, but the suggestion that Biden would be just more of the same is completely absurd.</em><br>
<br>
My point is that Biden would be just more of the same Democratic foreign policy, not more of the same as Trump.

Biden and his campaign have both made it abundantly clear that he doesn't need young voters or Sanders voters to win the election, let alone the endorsement of a small leftist organization like DSA. Maybe the thinking is that for every young person he loses, he'll pick up two moderate Republicans.<br>
<br>
Either way, an endorsement from DSA isn't going to convince leftists to suddenly fall in line and love with Biden, his legacy, or his policies. And it would only give conservatives more ammunition to attack him with after all the campaign ads about how he has made many women and young girls uncomfortable start to enter the territory of diminishing returns.

<em>I'm voting to stop our incipient decline into fascism and hopefully push the ball a couple yards downfield on health care and the environment.</em><br>
<br>
The neoconservative foreign policy legacy of Democratic administrations and leadership of just the past three decades (Iraq, Honduras, Libya, Sudan, Myanmar, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen) indicates that &quot;the incipient decline into fascism&quot; is something that will continue happening under a Joe Biden presidency as it did under Clinton and Obama.<br>
<br>
The football metaphor is an incidentally useful one because domestic politics would change somewhat with a Biden presidency, but for anyone too poor, too brown, and too far outside America's borders, it doesn't mean very much at all.

<em>It means that Obama's platform and agenda was more progressive than the Democratic nominees before him, Clinton's was more progressive than that, and Biden's will be more progressive yet. I don't see how that could mean very little if what you care about is actually moving the football down the field rather than symbolism.<br>
</em><br>
It's purely symbolism when we look at the lack of accountability for the CIA literally torturing people, the massive expansion of both the deportation and drone assassination industrial complexes, or for major financial institutions permanently destroying the global economy. This is the last time we had a president running on the &quot;most progressive platform ever&quot;.<br>
<br>
These are real things that happened and primarily they destroyed the lives of poor people of color who had the ill fortune to live outside of America's borders. I keep bringing these things up because it seems like no one wants to talk about them.<br>
<br>
Why should Biden be able to pick and choose what parts of Obama's legacy he wants to be associated with?

<em>And speaking of other non-white people, if Biden gets elected, those concentration camps we have for immigrants probably get shut down and hopefully some of those kids get returned to their families. I'd be a good thing to vote for him just for that.</em><br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-build-cages-immigrants/">The problem is those concentration camps were originally built and the massive deportation industrial complex was accelerated under Obama, while Biden was VP</a>.<br>
<br>
This contradiction exists because Obama, Biden, and other liberal politicians still see horrifying status quo systems (America's inherently and eternally white supremacist immigration policy, private healthcare, closed borders, forever wars, &quot;targeted&quot; assassinations, CIA coups, and ecocidal capitalism) as things that only need tweaks, preferably means-tested ones administered by Very Smart Technocratic Adults In The Room.<br>
<br>
Democrats, over the last few decades, have made it clear that we can get all the soaring woke rhetoric we like, but Yemeni kids will still get Hellfire missiles.<br>
<br>
Of course, we can see what those tough decisions made in the name of electability have gotten Democrats over the last 12 years.<br>
<br>
And a quick note, the term is generally &quot;people of color&quot;. I, and many other people of color, prefer that term because it would be nice to have just one thing in my life that isn't centered around whiteness and my lack thereof.

<em>A lot of people are trying to frame the present pandemic such that, after the dust settles, a certain number of deaths can be treated as the &quot;success&quot; level while anything past that is &quot;failure&quot;. This is fallacious, and it's just as frustrating when people apply this same binary thinking to climate change. We've already crossed multiple terrible thresholds on it, and yet more future ones exist that we might or might not cross. There is no game over after which we can give up: Every reduction of emissions makes a difference.</em><br>
<br>
This is true, but feedback loops and tipping points significantly curtail what is possible even with every reduction of emissions.<br>
<br>
Liberals and centrists have spent decades telling leftists a better world is not possible and it turns out they were right.<br>
<br>
<em>Plus, Trump being re-elected dramatically lowers the future chances of non-Republicans even being practically able to win anywhere. It's not like the fascism is decoupled from the Earth's future; even if Biden's climate policy were somehow negligible (it's not!), the difference for future generations remains vast just by having him in office over the alternative.</em><br>

<em>Moorooka, my parents are a short drive away from the US (now, global) epicenter of pandemic infections and deaths. Taking your metaphor to its logical conclusion is a life and death reality for people I love. I want to understand how people can equate Trump with Biden, if only in terms of how existential crises are handled — be they train derailments, hurricanes in Puerto Rico, or global pandemics — and ignoring all the rest of the dysfunction and corruption.</em><br>
<br>
I think a good primer to understand why, beyond the immediate timeframe, Biden and Trump are essentially equivalent on climate change is David Wallace-Wells's <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans.html">The Uninhabitable Earth</a>.<br>
<br>
The next <strong>year</strong> is a critical amount in our species and even if Biden gets elected and passed the most liberal/centrist agenda of our lifetimes (he doesn't, can't, and won't) will simply delay the inevitable climate cataclysm by just a few years. Not decades, but just a few years. The feedback loops heating up the world will just be too far along by that point (barring a massive, <em>radical</em> change at a civilizational level).<br>
<br>
Is it better than doing nothing? Certainly. But clawing back a few years of degraded quality of life is not the same as curing a late-stage terminal cancer.

I initially got into Sanders not because of his domestic policy, but because of his foreign policy. He cared about Palestinians, railed against America's bipartisan forever wars that have killed millions of people of color, and instead of calling Henry Kissinger a close friend, he spoke up against him. There was something <em>electrifying</em> seeing Sanders call out this monster who enabled a genocide my parents survived instead of pretending Kissinger was this elder statesman deserving of respect instead of indefinite solitary confinement.<br>
<br>
There are plenty of progressives and leftists out there, but few are at Sanders's level of renown while also remaining steadfast in international solidarity.<br>
<br>
Of course, his domestic policies are aligned with mine, even though he is still a little too moderate for me. As a queer person of color who grew up in poverty and then graduated into the wreckage of the 2008 financial crisis, I had seen firsthand how class intersected with white supremacy and other forms of marginalization to destroy and grind down people's lives. <br>
<br>
And as I learned more about how climate change will destroy this world, I was struck by how his policies were the only ones that reckoned with both the seriousness of the situation and the intersectional impacts of who will be (and are already) most devastated. <br>
<br>
2020 was the last year to start the hard, revolutionary work of total decarbonization to preserve a world for both current and future generations.<br>
<br>
But now that door is closed. A return to normalcy or even the Paris Accords is only a speed bump to what carbon dioxide, methane, and all the nightmarish feedback loops have in store for life on this planet.<br>
<br>
I will continue to organize, but I will also mourn. Not for Sanders, but for all of us and the world we could have had. What else is there to do?<br>

One thing that sticks out to me from The Intercept story is that Time's Up is possibly being too cautious about losing their 501c3 non-profit status:
<blockquote>Ruling out federal candidates marks as off-limits any member of Congress running for reelection, as well as President Donald Trump. Ellen Aprill, a professor of tax law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said that Time’s Up’s analysis is too conservative, and the group wouldn’t be putting its tax-exempt status at risk by taking a case involving a candidate for federal office as long as it followed its standard criteria for taking on cases. “As a legal matter, if the group is clear regarding the criteria used as to whom it is taking to court, show that these are long-established neutral criteria, and they are being applied to individuals completely independent of their running for office, it would not be a violation of tax law. Groups are allowed to continue to do what they have always done,” she said.</blockquote>

I'm curious what other legal experts think about this.<br>
<br>
The article was also updated today with more information about the sexual assault and the aftermath:
<blockquote>Reade has given an interview with podcast host Katie Halper, describing her time in Biden’s office, and what she described as a sexual assault in 1993. At the time, she told her mother, brother, and a friend who worked in Sen. Ted Kennedy’s office about the incident. Her mother has since passed away, but both her friend and brother told The Intercept they recalled hearing about it from her at the time. Reade’s friend, who asked to remain anonymous so as not to be part of the public blowback, said she discouraged Reade from coming forward at all, concerned that she would be attacked and would never get the apology she was hoping for. Reade and her brother, Collin Moulton, both said that their mother urged her to call the police, but her brother urged her to move on instead. “Woefully, I did not encourage her to follow up,” he said. “I wasn’t one of her better advocates. I said let it go, move on, guys are idiots.” (Moulton, who lives in Georgia, said he voted for Gary Johnson in 2016 and has no intention to vote for either Biden or Donald Trump.)<br>
<br>
The experience in Biden’s office derailed her life, Reade’s friend said. “Back then people assumed girls just get over it,” she said. “But no, it plants a seed and lives can spin out of control. Yes, everybody’s an adult, but guess what, so is he.” At the time, there was just no way that Reade’s effort to right the wrong could succeed, her friend said, but this time, she’s determined to be heard. “It was the ‘90s,” she said. “There was no Me Too. There was no Time’s Up.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>This video is about the ways the still-unfolding Covid-19 crisis is already remaking our sense of the possible. The Trump administration and other governments around the world are busily exploiting the crisis to push for no-strings-attached corporate bailouts and regulatory rollbacks. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is moving to repeal financial regulations that were introduced after the last major financial meltdown, as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. China, for its part, is indicating that it will relax environmental standards to stimulate its economy, which would wipe out the one major benefit the crisis has produced so far: a marked drop in that country’s lethal air pollution.<br>
<br>
But this is not the whole story. In the United States, we have also seen organizing at the city and state levels win important victories to suspend evictions during the pandemic. Ireland has announced six weeks of emergency unemployment payments for all workers who suddenly find themselves out of work, including self-employed workers. And despite U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden’s claims during the recent debate that the pandemic has nothing to do with Medicare for All, many Americans are suddenly realizing that the absence of a functioning safety net exacerbates vulnerabilities to the virus on many fronts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The reason we’re talking about this is that a very large and disruptive thing happened. Under the circumstances, past earnings are not very predictive of present conditions. Some jobs are not that impacted by Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. A few industries are probably even boosted. But other sectors are devastated. Owning a decent takeout pizza joint is suddenly a great career move, but being the chef of a Michelin-starred restaurant in Las Vegas is worthless.<br>

There’s no tractable way for the government to take all these considerations into account. But that’s why just giving money to everyone and accepting that some of it will go to those who don’t really need help is probably the best solution. If you’re really worried about it, you could always launch a big drive to exhort people to donate their checks if they have no immediate spending needs.</blockquote>

<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/156867/coronavirus-political-realignment-hell">The Political Realignment From Hell</a>: Trump’s coronavirus response stimulus package would bail out big oil. Biden-style Democrats will decry the cost. The planet will suffer (The New Republic)
<blockquote>As rigs are decommissioned—whether now or later—magnates like Harold Hamm and Trump’s other wealthy friends will walk away unscathed as wildcatters are left to deal with layoffs, poisoned air and water, and an ever-warming world; coal miners know this dynamic all too well. What shale-field workers and communities almost certainly need—more than a temporary loan to oil barons—is investment to diversify their economies with well-paid work and industries that strengthen former boomtowns for the long haul, fully honoring the contributions that generations of workers have made to the country and transitioning into the future of American energy. All of that also needs to be bolstered by the kind of strong social safety net that’s helping some European countries weather the COVID-19 crisis: commonsense policies like universal health care and paid sick leave.<br>
<br>
As of this week, neither Biden nor Trump seems likely to deliver that. With a history of boosting natural gas, a team of climate and energy advisers who’ve gotten millions from the fossil fuel industry, and a longtime distaste for deficit spending, Joe Biden isn’t likely to argue strongly for a big government investment package that pivots away from shale; former Biden adviser Jared Bernstein told the Post he might even support the idea of a shale bailout for Hamm and company. And in the absence of any meaningful alternative, Trump could become a hero of the shale and hospitality workers while the Democratic Party wags its finger at the price tag.</blockquote>

<a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/03/coronavirus-democratic-leadership-rent-suspension-cash-payments">Dealing With Coronavirus Requires Bold Action. The Democratic Leadership Won’t Take It</a> (Jacobin):
<blockquote>Nonetheless, centrist Democrats are also in the process of bungling the rapidly evolving debate around direct cash transfers — set to become urgent over the next few weeks, amid layoffs and the inevitable slowdown of economic activity, and already being floated by the Trump administration. Though House Democrats like Ilhan Omar and Ro Khanna are touting more ambitious proposals, there has seemed little appetite for direct, no-strings-attached cash transfers among the Democratic leadership thus far. Yesterday, Politico reported that none other than Nancy Pelosi “essentially shot down” the idea at a private caucus meeting last week — potentially positioning the leadership of America’s liberal opposition to the right of former Republican presidential nominee Senator Mitt Romney.</blockquote>

Do centrist or conservative American politicians ever ask if the price is too high for imperialist forever wars against poor people of color abroad? Or is balking at the price of intervention only applicable for them when the intervention actually helps the poor?

The modern academic job market colliding with the 2008 recession and the ongoing dismantling of the academy seems like the perfect storm for this kind of nightmare.<br>
<br>
So many people pursued doctoral degrees once the recession hit and when they graduated, they found a job market dominated by adjunct positions that offer little pay, no job security, and no advancement. When there were tenure track positions open for application, hundreds or thousands of people would all be competing for them. And as senior faculty retired, their positions would simply be dissolved and turned into...you guessed it, multiple adjunct slots.<br>

If we have to wait until &quot;post-emergency&quot;, then there will never be time to discuss these differences because there will always be another emergency (due to the lack of structural interventions that would actually provide some bulwark against these calamities).<br>

Moreover, I would love to hear more about Biden's thoughts on why he would veto M4A if it somehow made it past the House and Senate and why he has continued to lie about his support for the Iraq War.

<em>When people say that M4A is a morally necessary thing to do, do they mean that universal healthcare which doesn't impose a financial burden is a morally necessary thing to do, or literally that M4A and only M4A is morally required?

<a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/3/10/21169166/elizabeth-warren-working-class-women">Elizabeth Warren did better with college-educated white men than with working-class women</a> (Vox)
<blockquote>Not only did Warren fare worse with white working-class women than with white professional women, she fared worse with white working-class women than she did with white professional men. The exit polls do not provide a gender and educational breakdown of nonwhite voters, but you can also see that Warren did better with white male college grads than with the all nonwhites category.<br>
<br>
Massachusetts is not only Warren’s home state, but also the US state with the highest share of residents with bachelor’s degrees. In other words, it was the perfect terrain for her political profile. But not only did she finish in third place in Massachusetts, she finished in third place with women in Massachusetts despite her strength with white women who have college degrees. That’s how poorly she did not with men, but with women who are either nonwhite or lack a college degree.</blockquote>

Super interesting demographic data.

There is so much to cover in this piece about Biden, but the passages about the Iraq War in <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/03/democrats-you-really-do-not-want-to-nominate-joe-biden/?fbclid=IwAR2IrnV9Ozjt5OnzvueyDRFtroLjGMgHIm01FY-RpnnhGi-lc5Vps6eRago">this piece</a> are heartbreaking and infuriating:
<blockquote>Then there’s Iraq. In 2003, Biden was “a senator bullish about the push to war [in Iraq] who helped sell the Bush administration’s pitch to the American public,” who “voted for—and helped advance—the Bush agenda.” He was the war’s “most crucial” senate supporter. Biden repeated the myth that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, saying that “these weapons must be dislodged from Saddam Hussein, or Saddam Hussein must be dislodged from power.” The resulting war was one of the most deadly catastrophes in the history of U.S. foreign policy—the Iraqi death toll was in the hundreds of thousands or possibly even the millions, and 4,500 American troops died. And that’s just the dead: countless more were left permanently maimed, to suffer with PTSD for the rest of their lives. For every dead person, there is a family who will struggle forever to get over their loss. This is no trivial issue: In selecting a commander in chief, you want someone who doesn’t launch catastrophic wars of aggression. <br>
<br>
Now, you might be tempted to forgive Biden: Who among us hasn’t made the occasional disastrous decision that caused millions of deaths? But most unforgivably, Biden hasn’t reckoned with or atoned for what he did. Instead, he has simply lied about it repeatedly, because he knows how embarrassing the truth is. “I never believed they had weapons of mass destruction,” he said in October 2004, even though he had told the American people the exact opposite. In this campaign, Biden has been saying things like:
<blockquote>President George W. Bush “got them in, and before we know it, we had a ‘shock and awe.’ Immediately, the moment it started, I came out against the war at that moment.</blockquote>

Biden had to admit to fact-checkers that this was false. He has explained his conduct by saying that he wrongly placed his trust in George W. Bush to use his authority carefully, but the Intercept has reported that as early as 1998 Biden was saying things like “the only way we’re going to get rid of Saddam Hussein is we’re going to end up having to start it alone.” If you want to understand the anger of the veteran who recently confronted Biden about his record on Iraq, saying he had “blood on his hands,” it’s important to remember that Biden not only provided Democratic support for George W. Bush’s criminal war of aggression, but he has lied about what he did and blamed Bush for his actions. He has been “repeatedly suggesting he opposed the war and Mr. Bush’s conduct from the beginning, claims that detailed fact checks have deemed wrong or misleading.” Biden “got the Iraq war wrong before and throughout invasion, occupation, and withdrawal,” and worse, he did so because of the foreign policy “principles” he now touts as giving him unique diplomatic judgment. Buying the obviously-flimsy rationale for the Iraq War in the first place (while others were loudly opposing U.S. conduct) clearly calls into question whether someone should be put in charge of a vast nuclear arsenal (where they will have to make lots of decisions like these and evaluate evidence). But you also can’t forgive someone for something they’ve done wrong until they fully admit what it was that they did. </blockquote>

I still can't understand why Americans refuse to see the Iraq War (and the sanctions before them) as one of the deadliest and most significant acts of white supremacy in our lifetimes. A handful of loud leftist voices being <em>mean</em> online gets so much attention and that seems to be enough to discount and disqualify a leader, but where is the moral outrage for the leaders who have the blood and suffering of <strong>millions</strong> on their hands?<br>
<br>
Do those leaders get a pass because they just happen to be Democrats?

<em>I would like to suggest, as kindly as possible, that it is in Sanders' supporters best interests to listen and believe other democratic voters (and non-voters) when they explain why they're voting or not voting in a particular way. I am not suggesting that this is a leftist-only problem, but I've been told the reasons why I really was supporting Warren, and had my opinions and arguments dismissed as distractions. I've seen this happen with Sanders supporters rationalizing Biden's popularity with Black voters as them being duped, somehow, or them not paying enough attention - ignoring what Black voters themselves are saying about their reasons (this also happened with Clinton in 2016). It feels a lot like getting negged through white guilt - ignoring that the progressive Black and Latinx writers and thinkers that I follow seemed equally split between Sanders and Warren (if not slightly towards Warren). And it's frustrating, as someone who has Sanders as a clear second choice.</em><br>

<blockquote><em><a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/12/12/elizabeth-socialist-understand-capitalism-pro-market-leftist/">Socialists Will Never Understand Elizabeth Warren</a></em></blockquote>

This was a fascinating piece. Thanks for posting. Having seen the degradation of social democracies across the world and their (often not so) slow march toward fascism, I am deeply unconvinced that all capitalism and the free market need are a ton of very smart reforms by very smart people, but hell, I'd still prefer it to whatever Biden is serving up.<br>
<br>
Considering Warren's biggest base of support is relatively comfortable and well-educated white Americans, it makes sense why her pro-market-with-reforms ideology is so appealing to her supporters. Stuck in the liminal space between precarity and privilege, it's understandable why her supporters would want to restrain the worst excesses of late stage capitalism while not creating too much disruption to the parts of the status quo they enjoy. And as the piece mentions, it's literally a dead-end ideology:
<blockquote>If Warren wins, she will not only disappoint socialists. Her proposals may end up being too radical for Congress, but not nearly radical enough to tackle challenges such as climate change, which will require a rapid and dramatic transformation of the global economy if catastrophe is to be averted.</blockquote>

<em>Am I weird for thinking that change doesn't have to happen in just one way? The successes of one path do not preclude successes with another path.</em><br>
<br>
Change requires lots of different solutions, but there is still a core vision or principle behind that change. I like this Debs's quote a lot:
<blockquote>I am not a Labor Leader; I do not want you to follow me or anyone else; if you are looking for a Moses to lead you out of this capitalist wilderness, you will stay right where you are. I would not lead you into the promised land if I could, because if I led you in, some one else would lead you out.</blockquote>

For me, I lost my faith in both technocrats and the power of symbolic diversity as a result of the Obama years. Warren is the finest technocrat out there, but it's been a long time since I wanted that in political leadership.

<em>It's telling that you don't have a parenthetical example of major accomplishment like CFPB for Sanders, but it's so easy to find several for Warren who spent her life translating her ideology into real work done.

Warren's whole ideology and theory of change is based on a highly educated and professionalized technocracy taking down corruption and inequality (like the CFPB). Sanders's ideology is based on mass organizing around worker and community solidarity. For a technocrat like Warren, it makes sense that her intelligence/qualifications are selling points.<br>
<br>
How many advanced degrees does Dolores Huerta have or Eugene Debs had?<br>
<br>
If misogyny is 100% why Warren failed to gain traction in this primary and she also failed to secure support from people of color, does it mean people of color are inherently misogynistic? Or can people disagree on ideology and theories of change?

For all her plans and being the best potential president ever, Warren faced some significant headwinds. She consistently polled worse than Biden and Sanders in <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_warren-6251.html">head-to-head polls against Trump</a>. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/28/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-black-vote.html">Despite high profile endorsements</a>, she struggled to get the support of voters of color (<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/06/elizabeth-warren-campaign-nevada-111595">and struggled to retain her PoC staff in Nevada</a>).<br>
<br>
And then <a href="https://splinternews.com/elizabeth-warrens-deception-1829755302">there is the DNA test</a>, which is still immensely embarrassing and disgraceful to me, especially considering it was a result of her falling for Trump's trolling of all things.

As a person of color who grew up poor, let me be the first to tell you that while economic equality does not solve racism, it certainly takes much of the bite out of it.<br>

Universal healthcare and education programs disproportionately benefit people of color because of how intergenerational economic inequality goes hand in hand with intergenerational white supremacy.<br>

<em>All I want is a return to the conditions immediately preceding Trump</em><br>
<br>
I think I know what you're saying here, but the conditions immediately preceding Trump were not good for a lot of people, especially people of color and the poor. <br>
<br>
The deportation machine in overdrive and children in cages? Massive wealth and income inequality? Drone strikes killing thousands of civilians and special forces committing horrifying atrocities in countless countries? The architects and beneficiaries of the CIA torture program and the 2008 financial crisis allowed to get away without any accountability or punishment? The enabling of Saudi war crimes in Yemen?<br>
<br>
These conditions and impacts are what made Obama's presidency so disappointing for me and many other leftists/progressives. And it's those same conditions that make so many of us wary of another centrist president, especially one who wants things back to the way they were under Obama.

Biden supports continuing fracking and has been wishy-washy on renewables targets and whether he would support banning U.S. oil exports.

<em>Sanders supporters: I don't owe my vote to anyone -- it's the candidate's job to earn it.<br>

Also Sanders supporters: Warren should have stepped aside so that her votes could go to Bernie.<br>
</em><br>
I'm not sure how helpful these generalizations are. As a Sanders supporter, if the positions were switched, I would have wanted Sanders to step aside and rally for Warren. For me, a reformist progressive is far from the best option, but it is still a far better option than a third way neocon/neolib who thinks all we need is a little bipartisanship.<br>
<br>
At the same time, as mentioned above, it's not clear that Warren's supporters would automatically funnel to Sanders because she is a reformist progressive, not an anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist leftist.

<em>Why do black voters seem to like Biden? One possible answer is suggested by a Tweet from Antonio French, African-American former St. Louis alderman: &quot;Biden actually has the best, most clearly stated policy pitch: a return to Obama policies. You may not like that, but millions of people understand it immediately and do like it. It’s the best elevator pitch of any other candidate.&quot;</em><br>
<br>
The &quot;return to Obama policies&quot; where war crimes are forgiven, black and brown kids are put in cages here and killed by drones abroad, and class inequality continues to grow more and more certainly seems like a depressing pitch, but i assume that's not what these voters were thinking about when they look back on Obama.<br>

People of color are not a monolith (nor are they immune to the sway of name recognition). If you look at how young black people (and young people of color in general) vote compared to older black folks and people of color, you can also see <em>another</em> entirely different view of the world.<br>

It should be no surprise that the people who will live long enough to face the cataclysmic horrors of climate change feel a much greater sense of urgency about fighting it than the people who won't live long enough to see a blue ocean event.

I think that phenomenon can explained by the fact that &quot;leftie&quot; is a very different thing from &quot;leftist&quot;. I'm not sure where the term &quot;leftie&quot; came from, but to assume that anti-imperialist anti-capitalist leftists are the same thing as whatever &quot;leftie&quot; means is to erase a lot of really crucial differences between the two groups.<br>

Warren can definitely siphon off leftie voters who might feel more comfortable with her reformist ideology while that same reformist position being unpalatable to a leftist who is dedicated to anti-capitalism, anti-imperialism, and anti-racism.

<em>but &quot;you should have given us a more inspiring raft&quot; just stinks of privilege at this point.</em><br>
<br>
If you want to talk about privilege, it takes an immense amount of privilege to think it's fine to live in a world that is currently hurtling well past RCP8.5 and with even if any of the moderates win, it's fine if we still end up at a cataclysmic RCP6.<br>
<br>
Trump is horrifying for global warming, but Democratic centrists have plans that move so slow that for the billions of the global poor (who are all people of color), the effective amount of daylight between them is depressingly small.  Even Sanders's plan, Green New Deal and all, is too slow to fully stop what is coming, but at least it's something far more meaningful than what any of the moderates or even Warren has put forth.

Biden, Buttigieg, and Bloomberg all staying in the race seems to have a tremendous advantage for Sanders as he continues to consolidate the support of any voters who aren't interested in the moderate politics of RCP6 or, god forbid, 8.5 (or are young/materially vulnerable enough to actually live through the consequences of centrism in the face of climate change).

<em>Sanders makes moderates uncomfortable partly because he represents that the old neoliberal order of the past 50 years is over. It hasn't been great for a lot of people, but it's familiar and leaving it can be scary. Sanders vs. Trump means that both choices are choices for something a lot different. This is why defending Castro is such a big deal and not Kissinger, because, right or wrong, Castro has been the enemy for a long time and Kissinger hasn't been.<br>
</em><br>
You're right, but it's not just the neoliberal order; it's also the neoconservative order. And that's what makes Sanders so exciting for not just poor people and people of color in America, but for literally billions of people around the world who have been and are being harmed by the American foreign policy consensus.

It was a pointless, illegal war of aggression sold on lies that obliterated Iraqi society and killed perhaps half a million people, almost all of them innocent civilians. (Our own Soleimani, General David Petraeus, was connected to the operation of Iraqi torture dungeons and paramilitary death squads during the fight against the insurgency.)<br>

If Soleimani deserves blame for helping Bashar al-Assad brutally defeat Syrian rebels, Henry Kissinger deserves 10 times as much for orchestrating the bombing slaughter of perhaps a quarter million Cambodians and paving the way for the Khmer Rouge genocide that killed 1.7 million people.<br>

<blockquote>It is commonly said that many of the internal debates at the heart of the Democratic primary have been driven by purity politics—the devotees of the various candidates, some scoff, are fighting over proposals that will never pass and, by doing so, are choosing moral grandstanding over meaningful debate. This is wrong on multiple fronts. In the first place, the American people should have the right to know and discuss how the presidential candidates would address the problems facing the country if they could and why.<br>
<br>
This line of discourse critique falls especially flat when it comes to foreign policy. Over the course of generations, American presidents have been given an extraordinary amount of power to wage war and otherwise set American priorities abroad entirely on their own—without the assent of Congress or the broader public, and in many cases without even their knowledge. There are clear differences on these matters among the candidates vying for the Democratic nomination and within the party the next Democratic president will essentially lead. Whatever else may come of the Trump administration’s strike against Suleimani, the responses from the opposition so far have already been incredibly revealing.</blockquote>

The <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/30/the-shadow-commander?verso=true">New Yorker article</a> posted above has some really striking details about what could have been if it wasn't for recent history:
<blockquote>The good will didn't last. In January, 2002, Crocker, who was by then the deputy chief of the American Embassy in Kabul, was awakened one night by aides, who told him that President George W. Bush, in his State of the Union Address, had named Iran as part of an &quot;Axis of Evil.&quot; Like many senior diplomats, Crocker was caught off guard. He saw the negotiator the next day at the U.N. compound in Kabul, and he was furious. &quot;You completely damaged me,&quot; Crocker recalled him saying. &quot;Suleimani is in a tearing rage. He feels compromised.&quot; The negotiator told Crocker that, at great political risk, Suleimani had been contemplating a complete reëvaluation of the United States, saying, &quot;Maybe it's time to rethink our relationship with the Americans.&quot; The Axis of Evil speech brought the meetings to an end. Reformers inside the government, who had advocated a rapprochement with the United States, were put on the defensive. Recalling that time, Crocker shook his head. &quot;We were just that close,&quot; he said. &quot;One word in one speech changed history.&quot;</blockquote>

<br>
Being a &quot;bad guy&quot; in itself clearly isn't grounds for assassination for the American government. I hate that even &quot;leftist&quot; and &quot;progressive&quot; candidates have to preface their condemnation of this attack with how Suleimani is a bad guy.

<em>If the latter, taking a ‘both sides’ approach to this particular event is delusional, hence why you and others are getting pushback. The decision to kill Suleimani was taken in the context of US hostility to Iran, but was not a natural or inevitable or even (ignoring the personalities involved for a moment) an especially likely outcome of that hostility - the blame for the killing, and the consequences that flow directly from it, lies far more with Trump and his team than anyone else.</em><br>
<br>
And I see this event as path dependent on the prior bipartisan imperialist consensus that came before it, even if it is far stupider than what a normal neocon Republican would have done (and we are still living through the consequences of The Neocon Adults In The Room being very smart in Iraq).

<br>
Rather than concede the losses, however, the Pentagon's control team overseeing the exercise simply chose to bring the fallen back to life and then further artificially constrain the Red Team's abilities in a way that it could not possibly succeed, a disgruntled Van Riper later recounted in a private e-mail leaked by the Army Times. &quot;Instead of a free-play, two-sided game,&quot; he argued, &quot;it simply became a scripted exercise.&quot;</blockquote>

<em>It's worth remembering that history. It's also worth remembering that the last president before Trump pursued a path of diplomacy with Iran over military intervention (speaking very generally), and signed a major nuclear deal, a deal that Trump tossed out. In recent history, this isn't a both-sides bipartisan issue: there was no congressional vote over this, and Democrats in congress didn't ask for this. The DoD press statement is at pains to stress that this is something that the President ordered, not something arising out of general US military policy.<br>
</em><br>
There are millions of Iranians who still remember the deposing of Mossadegh and far more who were alive during the Shah's rule. The revolution was only four decades ago and its shadow is as long as ever. To arbitrarily constrain &quot;recent history&quot; to the parts that Western liberals feel comfortable about because it makes their &quot;side&quot; look better than Republican neocons is an ahistorical exercise and another form of white supremacy that obscures any understanding of how we actually got here. To dip back into domestic US politics, it would be like trying to understand mass incarceration without taking into account Jim Crow and redlining.<br>
<br>
I agree that Democrats in very, very recent history have shifted on Iran (and after 2016, have hopefully shifted even further on drone murder). Given how many neoconservatives have loudly lusted for war with Iran over the past few decades, I do think something like this would have happened under any modern Republican president.<br>
<br>
True, it wouldn't have happened as stupidly as it has happened under Trump, but I don't think &quot;having a smart plan to do something incredibly dumb and horrifying&quot; is actually a sign of intelligence.

I am still confused as to why &quot;not all boomers&quot; is somehow different from &quot;not all men&quot; or &quot;not all white people&quot;, especially given the people saying &quot;ok boomer&quot; were almost all born after the majority of carbon emissions were already in the atmosphere.<br>
<br>
Allies can come from all corners of life, but I hope I wouldn't see white people on here piping up about how <em>they're</em> not benefitting from white supremacy or men talking about how they're feminists and can't benefit from patriarchy.<br>
<br>
In any case, the majority of world-destroying carbon emissions were generated before 1989 and before the vast majority of Millennials, Generation Z, and beyond were born. To be upset at our language and our tone in the face of complete annihilation after decades of inaction is truly an astonishing act of entitlement.

<blockquote>The limitations of this model came into sharp focus recently, with the revelation that McKinsey may have inadvertently played a role in Saudi Arabia’s mistreatment of critics. On October 20th, the Times reported that the government of the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, had employed operatives to harass dissidents, including the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was allegedly murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, on October 2nd. The article included the revelation that McKinsey had prepared a nine-page report measuring the public perception of certain Saudi economic policies, and cited three individuals who were driving much of the largely negative coverage on Twitter: a Saudi Arabia-based writer named Khalid al-Alkami, a dissident living in Canada named Omar Abdulaziz, and an anonymous writer. After the report was created, Al-Alkami was arrested, and Abdulaziz’s brothers living in Saudi Arabia were put in prison. The anonymous Twitter channel was shut down.</blockquote>

<br>
“I’m a queer, disabled woman of color, so dating someone right wing or even centrist might mean dating someone who genuinely didn’t believe in my right to personhood,” Micha, a 25-year-old Londoner, says.

<br>
I find this strange.<br>
<br>
Taxation, the distribution of those taxes and benefits, and the economic system  underpinning all of this are massive determinants for how marginalized people thrive and suffer. That is a big part of the system that is behind systemic oppression.<br>
<br>
For example, it's not the alt-right that drives the majority of material harm to people of color in this country. It's systemic white supremacy in close concert with capitalism (and taxation policy).

<em>I think you're right: this is a dynamic at play! However, I think the usual domestic response is to point out that Clinton receives far, far more and more persistent vilification for this international history than prominent men involved in the same conflicts, including George W. Bush and Kissinger, but also including her own husband Bill Clinton. Speaking very personally, I do not see Bush, Kissinger, and Bill Clinton focused on to nearly the same extent or with the same level of vitriol.</em><br>
<br>
I would be very surprised if you traveled in the same internationalist leftist circles I did and didn't see that persistent vilification of Kissinger/Cheney/Bush.<br>
<br>
Beyond that, there are a couple things at play here. Both Kissinger and Bush have largely been rehabilitated by liberals and centrists (like the Clintons, Obamas, and the larger liberal/centrist establishment) and are now either seen as eldritch/elder statesmen or lovable goofy painters.<br>
<br>
And ironically enough, Bill Clinton's role in the American bipartisan foreign policy legacy of horror was much less than Hillary Clinton's role as Secretary of State under Obama. I don't ascribe this to any amount of extra virtue of Bill vs. malice on Hillary, but simply more the geopolitical cards they were dealt.<br>
<br>
What's more, she just ran an incredibly popular campaign 3 years ago. Bush and Cheney was last in power a decade ago. Bill Clinton? Nearly two decades ago. And while Kissinger's influence has never let up, he last held office a half century ago. I talk about their war crimes all the time, but I also recognize Westerners are more interested in the present than the time my parents lived in refugee camps five decades ago.<br>
<br>
Moreover, Clinton (and Obama and liberals in general) receive this specific kind of criticism from leftists because Western liberals explicitly position themselves as dramatically better than conservatives in everything. And practically speaking, I have more of a chance convincing liberals to change their minds than conservatives.<br>
<br>
<em>I would argue strenuously that Clinton did not help to popularize this strain of capitalist feminism because I would argue that it is the default strain of feminism championed by largely privileged women. It seems odd to lay this fault specifically at Clinton's feet when we have similar types of behavior gleefully perpetuated throughout the entire largely white and largely wealthy history of feminism. That does not mean that there isn't and wasn't a baby in that bathwater, but it is weird to hold Clinton responsible for this sin and not, say, Stanton or Anthony or Sanger.</em><br>
<br>
For me, the difference is that Stanton, Anthony, and Sanger weren't close friends with Kissinger and didn't sell cluster bombs and fighter-bombers to the Saudis. And Clinton is still held up by plenty of Western feminists and liberals <em>right now</em> as a symbol of liberation and hope (including at <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/04/last-night-the-wing-welcomed-hillary-clinton-into-the-coven.html">The Wing</a>).

<em>This is not a cage match between socialist feminism and radical feminism. I am seeing an argument between people taking an intersectional approach and people who think that taking a socialist and anti-capitalist approach is necessarily more important than interrogating misogyny in anti-capitalist spaces. If you think I'm characterizing you poorly, folks in the latter camp, please convince me otherwise: I am listening and open to being convinced! But the repeated appeals to socialism when critiques of misogyny come your way, regardless of reminders that class oppression is not the only marginalization that matters, are not remotely accomplishing that.<br>
</em><br>
An internationalist, socialist feminism is inherently intersectional, especially considering it is led by people of color fighting for material conditions that poor women of color in their communities are disproportionately harmed by. It requires understanding not just how gender, race, and other forms of identity operate to exploit people, but also how they are connected to capitalism, colonialism, and imperialism. There seems to be this very bizarre and ahistorical idea often posted here that leftists are white and it makes me, a queer person of color, feel like shit to see the sacrifices of so many leftist people of color, especially women of color, erased by a largely white, well-off, liberal community that talks so much about the importance of intersectionality.<br>
<br>
I think the larger dynamic is internationalist radical feminism vs domestic liberal feminism. It is understandable if liberals don't know about why the Jacobin piece mentions Clinton's imperialism because <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/02/22/saudi-christmas-present/">it is a horrendously ugly legacy dripping with the kind of material misogyny and white supremacy that has killed lots of people (and continuing to kill people)</a>. It contains the kind of cognitive dissonance and contradictions that collapse the entire liberal feminist project.<br>
<br>
Why do internationalist leftists of color keep talking about this even though she is no longer in power? It's for the same reason why we keep talking about <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/henry-kissinger-hillary-clintons-tutor-in-war-and-peace/">her close friend, Henry Kissinger</a> and George Bush: none of these people, who have done awful things to millions of poor people of color, have been held accountable. Clinton is not unique in her war crimes, but she is unique in that so many liberals still see her as a feminist icon who might, at worst, have &quot;problematic elements to [her] legacy&quot;.<br>
<br>
I appreciate you listening. At a personal level, my experience on Metafilter is one of immense frustration, sadness, and horror at what I see posted here. There is something surreal about Western liberals calling me a tankie who wants to send kulaks or whatever to camps. My family survived a genocide at the hands of Henry Kissinger, someone Clinton called a friend. Clinton then went on to do the same thing in Libya and Yemen. And to bring it full circle, the kind of feminism that she helped popularize in an immensely popular presidential campaign is now leveraged by this business to line the pockets of Saudi Arabia.<br>
<br>
If someone committed a genocide against your people and got away with it, how would you feel to see them praised all the time, especially in a community that generally sees itself as a moral and progressive place? Because that is my experience all the time on here. Again, thanks for listening because for me, it often feels like no one here is.

<em>We're asking whether it's reasonable for Jacobin to continue being highly critical of someone who represents, at least symbolically, the apotheosis of the political movements that Jacobin readers feel have failed them, or whether that necessarily just constitutes rank misogyny.</em><br>
<br>
As always, it's striking just how quickly and effortlessly the oppression of hundreds of millions of poor women of color (and poor people of color in general), is minimized and dismissed by Western liberals and disconnected from this conversation.<br>
<br>
So often this community focuses on systems of oppression and how they are related. So often are people dismissed as &quot;good guys&quot; and &quot;bad guys&quot; in discussions here. It is frustrating to see all of this understanding fall apart when the person and ideology being rightly and accurately criticized for enabling horrifying exploitation is one many users like.

<em>I stopped reading this article because it is just dripping with misogyny. It's premise is that when women do stupid capitalist things it's double super extra bad because women are supposed to lead the revolution. But it's fine when men do stupid capitalist things, they are immune from criticism. Expensive exclusive men's clubs - well, boys will be boys. If they lack solidarity with Bangladeshi garment workers, well what did you expect? Women, however, need to be pure and perfect. They can't be flawed people with muddled motivations.</em><br>
<br>
This identity-driven line of reasoning seems to be such a blessing for those in power hoping to evade criticism. Is it also racist to criticize Saudi Arabia's terrible actions because it is a country of people of color (which, funnily enough, also funds The Wing via WeWork)?<br>

<br>
The Jacobin piece specifically calls out the &quot;incidental social activities&quot; and the commodification and co-optation of feminism as the issue here, not that The Wing is a place just go hang out.<br>
<br>
Will Bangladeshi garment workers, who are women of color facing immense exploitation, feel much better if the boss at the top is a woman? Will precarious gig workers, who are often women of color and generating billions of dollars of value while seeing almost none of it, be thankful the boss at the top stealing their tips is a woman instead of a cishet white male tech dude?<br>

Even the worst contributors privately acknowledge the upcoming disaster. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/01/magazine/climate-change-losing-earth.html">But the worst part is that it could have been stopped or at least seriously curtailed 30 years ago</a>.<br>

I agree; I would much rather discuss what a candidate has said, done, and would do for (and to) people of color and other marginalized groups than try to figure out why there are demographic trends in candidate support.

It's important to remember that the last white Democratic presidential candidate dog-whistled about young men of color and called us &quot;superpredators&quot;. The last white Democratic president destroyed welfare, ramped up mass incarceration, and <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2016/04/bill-clinton-has-always-been-this-person">hosted a major campaign event for his first presidential campaign at the birthplace for the new Ku Klux Klan and posed in front of black inmates</a>.<br>
<br>
Both candidates enjoyed immense amounts of support from black voters (and people of color in general). There are lots of reasons for demographic trends towards support, but that doesn't change one's history, attitudes, or potential for doing further harm to poor people and people of color.<br>
<br>
This line from the above article reminds me of Biden (and Obama for that matter, whose legacy Biden is really trying to hold up as a reason to Vote For Joe):
<blockquote>Clinton has therefore always seemed somewhat of a paradox on race, a man who connected with black Americans emotionally while introducing policies that devastated them materially. His rhetoric, which acknowledged the trauma of slavery in a way no other president had before, and which treated African Americans as coequal participants in American life, has always made it appear as if Clinton must have been well-intentioned. </blockquote>

<em>I didn't watch the debate, just read through comments here and listened to half of Pod Save America. Seems like the pod save guys saw a completely different Joe Biden than the majority of commenters here. My impression was they thought Biden did over all except a few gaffs (I hate that word so much).</em><br>
<br>
Those are the liberal white guys, right? I am not at all surprised they didn't find Biden's comments about black parenting <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/09/13/joe-biden-democratic-debate-slavery/">utterly and completely disqualifying</a>.
<blockquote>Author Anand Giridharadas flagged the moment. “Is this not one of the most explicitly racist moments of all time in a Democratic primary debate?” he wondered. “Asked about his past comments denying responsibility, as a white man, for America’s sins, he gives an answer insinuating that black parents don’t know how to raise kids.”<br>
<br>
The answer appears to reflect not a campaign talking point, but Biden’s genuine thoughts on the question of race relations in the U.S. He has been criticized for his leading role in developing the policy infrastructure of mass incarceration, while couching it in dehumanizing and paternalistic language that was popular — and popularized by politicians like Biden — in the 1980s. The biases from which those ideas and that rhetoric sprang are still alive, if not necessarily well, in Biden’s mind 40 years later.<br>
<br>
Nikole Hannah-Jones, a journalist leading the New York Times Magazine’s “1619 Project” on the legacy of 400 years of slavery and its aftermath in America, said that Biden’s remark was revealing. “He talked about poverty, social workers needing to help families raise their kids and debunked science on vocab deficits,” she said. “He assumed we’d all understand he meant black folks even without saying — as if black is synonymous with poverty/dysfunction.”</blockquote>

<br>
Capitalism, due to its historical foundation in slavery and colonialism, is always going to be bad.<br>

I think I know where you're trying to go with this, but the sad irony is that Obama's syncretism of wokeness and neoliberalism benefited wealthy white men more than anyone else.<br>

Moreover, Obama helped build the deportation and concentration camp systems that Trump has taken to the next level and he also did nothing meaningful about fighting climate change.<br>

I thought Westervelt did a decent job of boosting WoC.

<em>And there is a massive world of difference between being a &quot;progressive prosecutor&quot; in 2004 and being one in 2019.</em> <br>
<br>
Unfortunately for her, she's running in 2020 and not 2004.<br>
<br>
<em>What people interpret as &quot;defending her record&quot; isn't the same thing as Biden defending his prior position on busing. A prosecutor, and even the attorney general, is still a lawyer. Lawyers have clients (the State, in her case), and have to follow the laws as they exist. There is some room for push-back on certain issues, and not on others. She has on a number of occasions taken responsibility for doing things she personally disagreed with because it was required of her.</em><br>
<br>
Just as Biden is rightfully criticized for voting for the Iraq War when he was under no obligation to do so, AGs have considerable leeway in terms of how they follow the laws as they exist. Harris herself demonstrated when she refused to defend Prop 8 in 2013.<br>
<br>
Harris can't take credit for the legitimately good things she did as AG while also evading accountability on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/kamala-harris-criminal-justice.html">all the legitimately bad things she did as well</a>.<br>
<br>
I mean:
<blockquote>Consider her record as San Francisco’s district attorney from 2004 to 2011. Ms. Harris was criticized in 2010 for withholding information about a police laboratory technician who had been accused of “intentionally sabotaging” her work and stealing drugs from the lab. After a memo surfaced showing that Ms. Harris’s deputies knew about the technician’s wrongdoing and recent conviction, but failed to alert defense lawyers, a judge condemned Ms. Harris’s indifference to the systemic violation of the defendants’ constitutional rights.<br>
<br>
Ms. Harris contested the ruling by arguing that the judge, whose husband was a defense attorney and had spoken publicly about the importance of disclosing evidence, had a conflict of interest. Ms. Harris lost. More than 600 cases handled by the corrupt technician were dismissed.</blockquote>

<em>cendawanita and hurdy gurdy girl mentioned this near the top of the thread, but I’m bringing it back since it’s been lost in thread drift: Casey and Jessica are enacting a policy change specifically requested of them by a number of BIPOC/POC ravelers (including myself, bias disclaimer) during a conversation where they invited people to share their experiences of racism in the fiber community at large and Ravelry in particular. That request was made because of specific hostile behavior on the part of Trump supporters on the site. There’s certainly grounds for criticism of this policy but “listening to what the marginalized members of your community say they need to feel welcome and safe, and then making it happen” is not how I would describe performative wokeness.</em><br>
<br>
It's great to hear they are listening to their PoC members and doing something about it. I hope your experiences do get better.<br>
<br>
But if they're explicitly saying &quot;white supremacy is not okay&quot; while also explicitly saying &quot;being a conservative or having conservative politics is still okay&quot;, then to me, it certainly seems like an extremely shallow analysis of what white supremacy actually is and how it harms people of color. Maybe that is pragmatically what they have to do, but I guess I'm looking for a bit more when it comes to allies.

There is nothing a centrist like Biden offers in terms of actually fighting climate change. This is a problem that requires the wholesale transformation of society across the world.<br>
<br>
The closest thing to the problem facing us were the Axis powers in World War 2 and even that massive shift in manufacturing and policy is nothing compared to what we need to do to save some part of humanity.<br>
<br>
None of the Democratic candidates really could do that in just 4 or even 8 years, but some could probably make some significant headway.<br>

<em>Any measure of American deaths in the Iraq war that doesn't include these many, many suicides is inherently a deflated count.<br>
</em><br>
<br>
Even if you include suicides, that death toll still is completely overshadowed by the millions of Iraqi dead, displaced, and critically injured. Most Americans, even on here, can't even begin to fathom that degree of horror and loss.<br>

If Americans valued civilian lives outside of their borders as much as they do American lives, they wouldn't end up in endless genocidal wars that also lead to more American veteran suicides.

<br>
The most staggering thing about the Iraq war is that a half million dead Iraqi civilians doesn't even capture the total death toll, especially when you factor in the resultant rise of ISIS.<br>

In comparison, America suffered 4,424 total deaths so far in the Iraq War.<br>

One of the things that bother me about pieces like this is how they don't really talk about what the Sacklers <em>did</em>:
<blockquote>From 1999-2017, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html">almost 400,000 people died</a> from an overdose involving any opioid, including prescription and illicit opioids.</blockquote>

400,000 Americans dead in 18 years (and it is only getting worse). This is a staggering loss of life that Al-Qaeda could only dream of. And the Sacklers got to make so much money from all that death!<br>
<br>
I get that some of the Sacklers weren't involved, but if you were that wealthy and wanted to truly clear your name, then spend every last cent taking down the ghouls ruining your name. That might be unfair, but as the Sacklers have no problem demonstrating, life is so much more brutally unfair in ways these people will never experience.

<a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2019/04/undocumented-ice-border-patrol-activists-arrests-citizens/">The deportation state that Obama and Trump radically expanded is no longer content to just go after the undocumented. Its targets increasingly include citizens and political dissenters of all kinds</a>:
<blockquote>Trump’s immigration policies should be opposed, first, because he, like Obama, is uprooting and expelling breathtakingly large numbers of immigrant populations who have resided, set up lives, and even made families in the country, sometimes for as long as decades. But even if you’re not undocumented — even if you actually approve of all this — there’s another reason to be worried. Just as marginalized groups have historically been used as the canary in the coalmine for justifying greater and greater encroachments on civil liberties (the way George W. Bush pointed to Muslim terrorists while he built up the post-September 11 surveillance state), so the activities of the increasingly extreme deportation machine are bleeding ever more extensively into the rest of American life.<br>
<br>
Last month, the NBC 7 television station in San Diego revealed that immigration agents with Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CPB), Border Patrol, Homeland Security, and the FBI had built up and were using a database of journalists, activists, and an immigration attorneys, all of whom were to be flagged for extra screening at the border. The lawyer and seven of the journalists are US citizens, and a number of them had reported getting extra scrutiny from border officials prior to the revelation of its existence.<br>
<br>
Earlier this year, the ACLU raised the alarm over what appears to be a trend of ICE targeting immigration activists for arrest around the country due to their political work, a fact that, as the organization points out, has grave implications for free speech. Many of the activists didn’t even have criminal records.</blockquote>

<blockquote>No matter how many op-eds come out in the next week calling for a complete shunning of Nielsen from public life, experience tells us that she’s probably going to be just fine. John Kelly and Don McGahn are already hard at work trying to repair their public perceptions. Oliver North is president of the NRA. War criminal Elliott Abrams lied to Congress, admitted doing so, took a few decades to work on D.C. think tanks, and has since worked in two more Republican administration.<br>
<br>
And then, when Abrams was called out for his crimes after returning for his latest stint at the forefront of American foreign policy with a special focus on coups in Latin America, all of his think tank buddies, regardless of political affiliation, jumped to his defense. And don’t forget all the torturers and liars from the Bush administration who have paid no price for their crimes, such as Torture Memos writer and current UC Berkeley law professor John Yoo. Or Henry Kissinger. Or on and on and on.<br>
<br>
According to Politico, Nielsen is “still plotting” what she wants to do after leaving the government, and her allies say she’ll probably “lay low for several months” in the meantime.

One of the most frustrating things about contemporary feminist/liberal discourse in America is that if Biden gets cancelled (and I hope he does), it will be for the individual actions described in the original post and throughout the above comments, instead of, as you mentioned, the hundreds of thousands (likely millions, at this point) of women killed because of the war he voted for.

<a href="https://jewishcurrents.org/why-are-the-democrats-doing-bibis-dirty-work/">Some Democrats are joining Republicans in reviving anti-BDS legislation</a>:
<blockquote>Before, the Democratic leadership and more hardline pro-Israel Democrats might have been content to let S. 1 die a quiet death in the House, a failed Republican scheme to divide and shame the Democrats amidst the Trump-induced government shutdown. But after the flimsy allegations of antisemitism against BDS-supporting Rep. Ilhan Omar blew up, 57 Democrats and 52 Republicans between the Senate and the House have found a way to resuscitate the effort by co-sponsoring the two new bills. Thanks to the eager participation of these key Democrats, the new anti-BDS bills have removed the poison pill boycott language, instead simply offering a broad condemnation of BDS and its supporters, which reads like a not-so-subtle smear of certain members of the Democratic caucus.</blockquote>

<a href="https://splinternews.com/team-pelosi-was-reportedly-trawling-for-anti-medicare-f-1833740852">Team Pelosi Was Reportedly Trawling for Anti-Medicare for All Research</a>:
<blockquote>Today, Politico reported on another meeting, this one with health policy researchers, in which Primus “dismissed Medicare for All during the private session as an unhelpful distraction” and asked for “more research focused on the risks and tradeoffs of Medicare for All.”<br>
<br>
According to the site, Primus raised concerns that Medicare for All would “distract” from the party’s “core health agenda.” This messaging is common across single-payer opponents, from Pelosi herself to the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, a healthcare industry-backed lobbying group that was formed to defeat single-payer and which frequently says Democrats should focus on “building upon the progress we’ve made” and protecting the ACA. Primus believes Democrats should focus on protecting pre-existing conditions and lowering drug prices, per the site.<br>
<br>
The most troubling part is Primus’ reported “invitation to discredit the idea, or at least amplify its risks” with research. Pelosi spokesman Henry Connelly told Politico that “no one has anything to fear from good faith research on Medicare for All.” He also said: “Wendell absolutely did not ask for any kind of one-sided analysis of Medicare for All, and anyone who says otherwise wasn’t actually listening,” and that, “As Democrats, across the entire spectrum, we believe in legislating based on facts, data and honest analysis.”</blockquote>

<em>One thing I missed when I lived there was Hainan chicken, which is apparently a common thing in parts of the greater LA area. Actually, I missed a lot, since it's hard to get to everything. Did you know that I never made it to Langer's the whole time I lived there? I also never tried the Ethiopian food on that one street, and I never made it to that suburb that was supposed to have the best Indian food outside India (I used to live with an Indian guy who took a lot of trips there). <br>

* For Hainan chicken, Side Chick is massively popular and now has a proper retail location in the Westfield Santa Anita mall; a lot of Thai restaurants in Thai Town also serve their own properly great version<br>
* Langer's is great, but the price is pretty ridiculous for just a sandwich<br>
* Little Ethiopia is wonderful! Although it's hard to say if Lalibela or Meals by Genet is the best joint in the city<br>
* The neighborhood you're talking about is Artesia, which is great, but I'd also recommend people check out Little Bangladesh (located right inside Koreatown)<br>

<a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2019/04/pete-buttigieg-president-democratic-primary/">Have You Heard? Pete Buttigieg Is Really Smart</a>:
<blockquote>The question of what “smart” even means and why this type of smart should matter in a presidential race got less attention. One person rightly asked, “are you sure he’s not just smart in the ways you also fancy yourself to also be smart.” No one asked why this particular form of well-credentialed “smart” should “count for quite a lot.”<br>
<br>
That’s because while the [professional managerial class] are often eager to be more inclusive about who gets to be “smart” — women, black people — they have tremendous faith in the concept itself. They love rich people whose intelligence has made them prosper: they may cringe at the science-denying Koch Brothers but they went into deep mourning when Steve Jobs died. They devour Malcolm Gladwell’s veneration of the wisdom of genius entrepreneurs over the plodding, clueless masses.<br>
<br>
This notion of “smart” allows elites to recast inequality as meritocracy. In this narrative, you’re rich because you did well in high school and went to Princeton, not because capitalism has taken something from someone else and given it to you. Yet the culture of smart is not all smugness; it also contains a heavy dose of fear. The PMC understands that while it’s fun to brag about having a kid like BOOTedgeedge, it’s not optional (like, say, having a pet that can do weird tricks, a cat that can use a human toilet, for instance). In the neoliberal order, if you’re not born into the top 0.1 percent, you have to be “smart” and unusually talented and motivated, otherwise you will not only lose what privileges you have, but possibly not even survive. As New York Times columnist Tom Friedman once gleefully proclaimed, “Average is over.”</blockquote>

I sometimes see this cult of meritocracy on here and it's kind of chilling, but I couldn't put it to words until this piece articulated it. Some of the smartest people I went to school with now are working at consulting and defense companies, relentlessly optimizing war crimes and political/labor repression for the worst companies and regimes in the world.

<em>No that one's true, food in LA is amazing and unbelievably diverse.</em><br>
<br>
Yes, I completely agree. Having lived in both cities, LA trounces New York in the food arena so hard it isn't even fair.<br>
<br>
After having spent so much time around New Yorkers and their illusory superiority about their city's food compared to LA, I loved this article so much.<br>
<br>
<em>It's hilarious, because people honestly believe that LA is this awful, empty husk of a city that's all cars, smog, and shallow wannabe celebrities. When I told people I was moving there, more than one person said it was the city &quot;where dreams go to die&quot; and that I'd wind up miserable, surrounded by stupid, superficial people; I ended up loving LA, and I met some amazing and smart people there. Plus, it's like people don't realize that LA isn't all white people trying to be celebrities. The stereotype is some white woman snapping a selfie in front of the Hollywood sign, but the majority of the people I knew were Latinx or Asian (which is why I loved that this article called pizza a kind of tlayuda, and a bagel a kind of bao -- NY Times is all &quot;it's like a bagel, but...&quot;).<br>
</em><br>
Yep! People's feelings about LA usually say a lot more about their own preferences/privilege/circumstances than anything about the city. If all you know about LA are boring white people, well...

The president who occupied the White House before Trump used drones to murder children who were American citizens without trial, sold cluster bombs to Saudi Arabia and enabled a genocide in Yemen, and built up the deportation machine that Trump amplified into something even worse.<br>

23 years ago, Adolph Reed Jr. wrote this in the Village Voice about someone who ended up president:
<blockquote>In Chicago, for instance, we’ve gotten a foretaste of the new breed of foundation-hatched black communitarian voices; one of them, a smooth Harvard lawyer with impeccable do-good credentials and vacuous-to-repressive neoliberal politics, has won a state senate seat on a base mainly in the liberal foundation and development worlds. His fundamentally bootstrap line was softened by a patina of the rhetoric of authentic community, talk about meeting in kitchens, small-scale solutions to social problems, and the predictable elevation of process over program — the point where identity politics converges with old-fashioned middle-class reform in favoring form over substance. I suspect that his ilk is the wave of the future in U.S. black politics, as in Haiti and wherever else the International Monetary Fund has sway. So far the black activist response hasn’t been up to the challenge. We have to do better.</blockquote>

Buttigieg seems to be cut from much of the same cloth, but nowhere nearly as charismatic or inspiring. <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/henrygomez/pete-buttigieg-chick-fil-a-gaydar">His answer about Chik-Fil-A</a> reminds me of that same awful reflexive triangulation too.

<a href="https://splinternews.com/only-we-can-save-us-1833539979">Only We Can Save Us</a>: 
<blockquote>Donald Trump has thrown children in cages. His deportation force has terrorized families all over the country. He’s sided with white supremacists. He’s imposed a quasi-religious test on entering the United States. He is an unrepentant bigot who curries favor with other unrepentant bigots. All of this is more than enough to justify a forced removal of office. But with the Mueller investigation now over, it should be clearer now than ever before that the only chance we have for that to happen is in the 2020 presidential election.<br>
<br>
Is it an adequate form of accountability? No, absolutely not. Looking back at recent transitions of power, the fact that the most significant rebuke of George W. Bush’s war presidency we saw didn’t involve a cell at the Hague but rather the landslide Democratic victory in 2008 is a pittance, especially considering the ultimate similarities between the Bush and Obama presidencies.<br>
<br>
The next Democratic president, whenever that happens, will in all likelihood call for a return to norms and a period of healing or whatever bullshit helps them feel good about the country they’ve signed up to run. Trump will never face real consequences for his actions like you or I would. It will be undoubtedly infuriating.<br>
<br>
But getting Trump out of office in 2020 should be viewed as more than a consolation prize; it’s an opportunity to end the worst aspects of Trump’s presidency, to protect vulnerable people, and to make the United States a more livable place for everyone. Outside of a popular uprising—which, I cannot stress enough, would be vastly preferable to waiting around for an election—the best shot to do that will come in November 2020. And the only way we’re going to get there is by doing politics, not by running away from them.<br>
</blockquote>

Ironically enough, last week was the 16 year anniversary of the Iraq War, an immoral and illegal war that has led to millions of lives lost, even more people displaced and mutilated, and absolutely no consequences for the powerful politicians behind it other than more money and power for them.<br>

Trump getting away with it is only business as usual for America.

I believe in both incredibly strong universal programs and reparations that actually mean a damn.<br>
<br>
I also believe in helping as many marginalized people as possible as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
That's why universal programs are so important. They minimize the time it takes to meaningfully help the most marginalized among us (which will disproportionately end up being black, Latino, and Native American people anyway) while we figure out (and fight for, because there will absolutely be a ton of legal fights) how to enact meaningful reparations.<br>
<br>
Because people need food, shelter, healthcare, good jobs, and good schools right now while we wait a decade or longer to enact reparations.<br>
<br>
And I hope we can provide the same for all the people of color who have had their lives destroyed by American foreign policy.

<em>I’m always surprised that reparations talk never really seems to look at the institutions that both directly profited from slavery and still have the profits in their coffers, without having to go through any intermediaries. Chase held mortgages for slaves, profited on the interest on slaves, and its banks owned slaves itself at one time, for example. Is it because banks are powerful lobbywise?<br>
</em><br>
You don't even have to go back that far. Wells Fargo had a predatory lending department that literally called their financial products &quot;<a href="https://consumerist.com/5283290/affidavits-on-how-wells-fargo-gave--ghetto-loans-to-mud-people.html">mud people loans</a>&quot; in the last decade.<br>

We would need all three systems of government packed with Sanders and Warren loyalists in order to actually hold the financial industry accountable, let alone enact meaningful reparations.<br>

And we should! It is a moral and ethical imperative.

In her Thursday comments, Pelosi showed just how stupid everything about this affair has been. She said she does not believe Omar was anti-Semitic, but that she may not have “understood the full weight of the words” she had said. She also said the resolution was going to be about “anti-Semitism, anti-Islamophobia, anti-white supremacy” and that it would not mention Omar’s name because “it’s not about her.” Uh, it clearly is about her, but whatever.<br>
<br>
Pelosi is clearly trying to manage the divide over Omar that has split open between various factions of her caucus. She’s obviously going to infuriate one side or the other no matter what she does. That’s not the interesting thing. The interesting thing is that Pelosi seems to have thought going after Omar would be simple and easy, only to find that the political landscape—and her grip on her membership—has changed. All of a sudden, Nancy Pelosi—who has been as predictable an AIPAC-and-Israel ally as any establishment figure in DC—is watching the ground shift under her feet, and she doesn’t quite know how to handle it.<br>

<blockquote>

...An analysis of recent polls from November of 2018 to March 2019 shows Sanders is more popular with people of color than white people, and women like Sanders as much as men do, if not more. He leads every other possible 2020 contender with Latino voters and lags behind only Joe Biden — who hasn’t announced a bid yet — with African-American voters. Sanders’ polling numbers with black voters are double that of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), according to a March Morning Consult poll.<br>

<a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2019/03/bernie-sanders-brooklyn-rally-medicare-for-all/">Among the Brooklyn Bernie Bros</a> - Whatever the media depiction, Bernie Sanders’s first presidential campaign rally was attended by large numbers of women and people of color. We talked to some of them about why they support Bernie.
<blockquote>

I asked twenty-two-year-old Leen Dweik, who lives in Manhattan and whose family comes from Palestine, if she agreed with the liberal talking point that Bernie is unable to represent people of color because he’s a white man. “No, no, no,” said Dweik. “Policy over identity.”<br>
<br>
“People who say he’s just an old white man and it’s more of the same are ignoring the importance of his policies for people of color,” she continued. “The people who will benefit the most from Medicare for All, for example, will be working-class people of color. When he talks about championing unions and workers’ rights, he’s talking about the well-being of working-class people of color. As someone who’s a person of color and an immigrant, not an American citizen, I would vote for him if I could.”<br>
<br>
When I asked about the proposition that Bernie is uniquely bad on race, Vafai, whose family came to the US from Iran, responded that Bernie is “clearly just being targeted because he’s taking on the major institutions that have caused structural racism to occur and continue.”</blockquote>

The interviews with working class people of color are really refreshing and should give some insight into why his policies are not for the benefit of young white dudes.

Maybe the comparison would make more sense if Poland was traditionally run for centuries by Somali Muslim women. And it had spent decades pouring money and military technology into Israel and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/12/18/she-lost-her-school-job-after-refusing-sign-pro-israel-pledge-now-shes-filing-lawsuit/?utm_term=.8184ac9adc45">had laws that literally punished its own citizens for lacking sufficient allegiance to Israel</a>.<br>
<br>
As mentioned earlier, bipartisan responses like &quot;questioning support for the U.S.-Israel relationship is unacceptable&quot; really just seem to keep proving her point. I struggle to see the problematic nature of a statement that is no different from how AIPAC lobbyists themselves happily brag about and describe their work and success in private. Ilhan Omar's problem seems to be that she is doing it a) in public, b) in a manner critical to the military industrial complex and American empire c) while being a black Muslim immigrant woman.

<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/153228/shameful-campaign-silence-ilhan-omar">The Shameful Campaign to Silence Ilhan Omar</a>:
<blockquote>Over the weekend, leading Democrats met in what the New York Times characterized as a “frenzied effort to respond to Ms. Omar.” By Monday night, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had circulated a draft resolution condemning anti-Semitism. It did not mention Omar—or the Islamophobic smears she had faced the previous week—but its target was clear. The draft mentioned actual, and terrifying, instances of anti-Semitism, including Robert Bowers’s murder of 11 Jews at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh last October, but nearly a fourth of its length was devoted to “the myth of dual loyalty.” It even cited Dreyfus, misspelling his name.<br>
<br>
Omar, however, was not actually hauling out the old dual loyalty trope. Rather, the Minnesota representative was questioning a situation in which American politicians, the overwhelming majority of whom are not Jewish, have for years with near-unanimity fought to quash all public criticism of an actual foreign country. No fewer than 26 states have passed legislation punishing businesses and individuals who, to protest Israeli policies toward Palestinians, support the movement for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions. Some require anyone who wishes to do business with the state to sign an oath declaring that they do not boycott Israel. Others create official blacklists of BDS supporters. The U.S. Senate’s first legislative priority in January, after a five-week government shutdown, was to pass a bill authored by Marco Rubio that gave a federal blessing to state and local anti-boycott laws. Predictably, when Rashida Tlaib spoke out against it, tweeting that the Senate bill’s backers “forgot what country they represent,” Rubio slammed her for taking “a typical anti-Semitic line.”<br>
<br>
Anti-Semitism is all too real. Criticizing Israel is not anti-Semitism. Nor is calling out politicians who are more interested in shielding Israel from embarrassment than in protecting the constitutional rights of their own constituents. So far, the Democratic establishments’ attempts to chastise Omar have only made her point more strongly. On Monday, Representative Juan Vargas condemned her on Twitter for perpetuating “hurtful anti-Semitic stereotypes,” adding that “questioning support for the U.S.-Israel relationship is unacceptable.” The language was strikingly similar to that Democratic congressman Eliot Engel used last fall, when he suggested that Omar, Tlaib, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, all of whom had spoken up for Palestinian rights, “need to be educated” about Israel. “We have overwhelming support for Israel in the Congress,” he said, “and … it will continue that way.”</blockquote>

This whole incident has been a huge drag in many ways, but it is really clarifying to see so much bipartisan saying-the-quiet-part-loud.

<blockquote>GOP Congressman Steve King has served in the U.S. House of Representatives for sixteen years, yet Democrats – who controlled the House for four of those years and now control it again – never formally rebuked or condemned him until last month (they did so at the same time that Republicans removed him from his Committee assignments due to a long history of white supremacist remarks).<br>
By extremely stark contrast, Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar – the first black Muslim woman ever elected to the Congress – has served in the House for a little more than two months, and House Democratic leaders have already formally condemned her once and are preparing to so again, this time even more harshly and officially, on Wednesday.<br>
<br>
[...]<br>
<br>
THERE ARE SO MANY POINTS to be made about this episode, each of which could justify its own entire article. It is, for instance, beyond dispute that what Omar is saying is true given that the very first bill passed by the U.S. Senate this year was one that allowed punishment for American citizens who boycott Israel, while U.S. citizens in 26 states are formally punished for boycotting this foreign nation, as we reported last month in the case of a Texas elementary speech pathologist who lost her job for refusing to sign a pledge not to boycott Israel (to keep her job with Texas, she’s allowed to boycott any other nation or even an American state: just not this one favored foreign nation).<br>
<br>
Thus far, the two federal courts to rule on such laws have struck them down as unconstitutional violations of the free speech rights of American citizens on behalf of Israel.<br>
<br>
How can anyone possibly pretend that it’s invalid or offensive to observe, as Congresswoman Omar did, that some in America demand allegiance to a foreign nation when American citizens are allowed to boycott American states but are punished for boycotting this one specific foreign nation?</blockquote>

It really is something that Steve King went sixteen years before facing a rebuke from Democrats while it's only been two (very long) months for Ilhan Omar.

<em>certainly, the second amendment isnt going anywhere and so it can seem hopeless to try and reduce gun violence. yet ads for cigarettes used to be aired on tv and fetishized, but after the death toll became clear, they were regulated into oblivion. cigarettes remain legal and highly addictive, but their use has plummeted. that seems to me to be the most practical way to make guns less common too. tax them heavily. make them more expensive. limit their advertisement. fund PSAs on gun safety and spotting mental illness and depression among gun owners in one's family. by doing the exact opposite, these Insta characters are not helping.<br>

The problem is that most liberals and leftists worry about and expend most of their political energy on mass shootings (which are tragic, but kill relatively few people). Even in the worst years, I don't think mass shootings have killed more than a 1,000 people.<br>

<a href="https://splinternews.com/bernie-continued-1833011354">Hamilton Nolan writes about the rally</a>:
<blockquote>

Bernie took the stage on the quad of the college he went to decades ago and called for economic and social and racial and environmental justice. He called for Medicare for all and a $15 minimum wage and prison reform. He called for affordable housing and child care and tuition-free college and stronger Social Security and new infrastructure and taxes on the rich. He called for the end of private prisons and cash bail. He called for campaign finance reform and immigration reform. He said he will take on Wall Street and insurance companies and drug companies and fossil fuel companies. He said all of the things that he said four years ago, and that he said the decade before that, and the decade before that. One reason why Bernie Sanders has never been a darling of the news media is that he is a broken record, a characteristic that offers little in the way of “news” as it is traditionally imagined. That is a consequence of having actual beliefs rather than campaign strategies.<br>
<br>
I did not believe that Bernie Sanders should have run for president in 2020. Though I love him and share his politics and backed him last time around, I felt that the best way to advance the policies we both believe in would have been for him to back a candidate who shares his beliefs but who was younger, and perhaps not a white male. I mostly felt that Bernie is just too old. That his time as a viable presidential candidate has passed, and that he could do the most good by encouraging up and coming leaders behind him to carry his movement forward. I feared, and still fear, the possibility that he and Elizabeth Warren will split the vote on the left and open the door for a more centrist candidate to take the nomination. I had many spirited-to-angry discussions with Bernie partisans about this, where I always wondered what the concrete, practical policy differences would be between a Bernie presidency and a presidency of say, Warren.<br>
<br>
A week ago, a union man made an argument to me that resonated. He said that true change will never come from electoral politics; it will always come from movements. Electing any U.S. president will not bring about the changes that the labor movement seeks, because a president is by definition embedded in and, indeed, the leader of a system that a movement seeks to break. The qualitative difference between Bernie and the other Democratic candidates, he said, was not that Bernie himself would make the changes we need, but that Bernie respects activism enough to not stop the movements from doing the things that they need to do to make the changes—the things that are usually viewed by the existing system as war. Bernie, he argued, would be the only one who would not stand in the way of the movements, where the real work happens. He was in his own way making the very same argument that Erica Garner did, before she died of a heart attack at the age of 27: Bernie is not really a politician. He is an activist. What we need is not just someone to hold the White House door open for the movement, but also to not call the cops when the movement starts to paint the White House black.<br>
<br>
I do not know yet who I will vote for in the Democratic primary. But it is hard to deny that Bernie has a purity of spirit that is unmatched in the field. His policy prescriptions are good, but it is his quality of being magnetically attracted to the right side of things that could come in handy when America’s situation gets uglier. As it surely will. Shortly after Bernie launched into his speech on Saturday, the crowd began chanting: “Ber-NIE. Ber-NIE.” It started on the risers behind him, and spread quickly across the thousands of cold spectators with warm hearts. “BER-NIE! BER-NIE!” The man himself looked momentarily annoyed. Then he cut everyone off. “No, it’s not Bernie, it’s you,” he shouted. “It is all of us together.”</blockquote>

This pseudo-story not only has rendered the term “socialism” meaningless—conflating national health insurance and graduated tax systems with a government takeover of the entire economy—but it is erasing important distinctions in Democratic candidates’ policies that ought to be the focus of debate.<br>

I spoke over the phone with Walidah Imarisha, an educator and expert on black history in Oregon and she was quick to explain that the state is only really exceptional in that it bothered to proclaim its goals of white supremacy so openly.<br>

<br>
Today, while 13 percent of Americans are black, just 2 percent of Oregon’s population is black. This is not some accident of history. It’s a product of oppressive laws and everyday actions that deliberately excluded non-white people from a fair shot at living a life without additional obstacles being put in their way.<br>

<em>Facially neutral policies often have disparate impacts, not only across racial lines but also w/r/t gender, age, (dis)ability, &amp;c. That's not exactly a controversial premise; whether any given policy -- redistributive or otherwise -- will have a disparate impact can be hard to predict and may not be intended. One of the ways to prevent discriminatory outcomes is by building in affirmative steps, in advance, to prevent them, rather than simply assuming that a universal policy will have a uniform and equitable impact.<br>
<br>
Or: redistributive policies are not necessarily racist, no, but it's worth asking whether any specific redistributive policy will have a disparate impact that could be avoided by working in some other fasion. Assuming that policies cannot be racist because they're race-blind is...really, really risky, basically? <br>
<br>
(Talking about that in terms of 'polices' and not in terms of actual, specific policies is not going to be very fruitful, I think, but if you want examples of specific nominally universal policies that weren't really so universal in practice, there's a long history of discrimination in American you could pick dozens of examples from; that's also a bit of a derail here, though.)<br>
</em><br>
<br>
I am well aware of the devastating history of redlining, Jim Crow, the G.I. Bill, and so on. But given the racist administrations that implemented them, those policies were not at all neutral, universal, nor even all that redistributive.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/02/20/2020-candidates-reparations/">See Briahna Gray</a>:
<blockquote>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS was buffeted repeatedly by criticism that he didn’t do enough to connect with black Americans in the course of his 2016 presidential run. Much of that criticism was fair. But Sanders’s failure was in articulating how his policies would benefit black Americans, not in advancing policies that would benefit us.<br>
<br>
Prior to the 2016 election, Ta-Nehisi Coates, who ultimately voted for Sanders, wrote, “Sanders’s basic approach is to ameliorate the effects of racism through broad, mostly class-based policy — doubling the minimum wage, offering single-payer health-care, delivering free higher education. This is the same ‘A rising tide lifts all boats’ thinking that has dominated Democratic anti-racist policy for a generation.”<br>
<br>
But the Democratic Party has never backed anything approaching the redistributive goals contemplated by Sanders’s 2016 agenda. The party’s economic plan has historically focused on economic mobility, “access” to “opportunity,” and removing barriers to participating in a capitalist economy. Child care programs, paid sick leave, and job training initiatives are promoted as strategies to ensure that all Americans can participate in what most Democrats see as a fundamentally functional system.<br>
<br>
By contrast, politicians like Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren challenge the system itself, because they view it as fundamentally inequitable. Leftists support traditional interventions that meaningfully ease the burdens of those struggling under capitalism. But they also seek to change the fact that profits in this country currently flow disproportionately to a privileged few at the very top — at the expense of wage growth for the workers whose labor generates those profits. As Sanders argues, if 90 percent of profits go to the top 1 percent, having technical “access” to the 1 percent isn’t enough; the system itself must change.<br>
<br>
This structural approach is a game changer for African-Americans. Because the value of wealth compounds, capitalism rewards the historical possession of wealth; the ability to invest today is worth more than the ability to do so in the future. That being the case, how can black Americans, first enslaved and then legally barred from participating in capitalism for the overwhelming majority of this country’s history, begin to catch up with a systemic adjustment to the system?<br>
<br>
The answer is we can’t. There will be no racial equality under capitalism.<br>
<br>
It would take an estimated 228 years for black Americans to earn as much wealth as white Americans possess today, at which point blacks still would not have drawn even, because whites would presumably have accrued more wealth during that time as well. Simply put, closing the racial wealth gap demands a systemic approach.<br>
<br>
It is true that universal programs without race-specific interventions are not enough. The failures of the New Deal illustrate how universal solutions can inadequately provide for the needs of the marginalized. But the reality that universal programs don’t always go far enough should not be perverted into an argument that universal programs aren’t integral to the task of closing the racial wealth gap.</blockquote>

I would agree that Medicare for All probably would lead to racist impacts if it was implemented by Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions. But that's not what Sanders's administration would look like and if you honestly think it would, then it might be a good time to ask yourself why you are in the minority of women and people of color who feel that way about Sanders.

<em>Universal economic redistribution that derides identity politics and insists on race-blind policy-making enables white supremacy. I wouldn't even call it &quot;inadvertent&quot; at this point.

<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/foreign-policy-distinguishes-bernie-sanders-2020/583279/">It’s Foreign Policy That Distinguishes Bernie This Time: He’s challenging American exceptionalism in a far more radical way than his 2020 competitors are.</a>
<blockquote>This time, by contrast, Sanders arguably talks about foreign policy more than any other declared candidate does. Of the four senators who launched their candidacies via video—Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, and Sanders—only his mentioned foreign policy. Over the past two years, Sanders has given two speeches outlining a broad foreign-policy vision. (Warren has delivered one, last November at American University, which she paired with an essay in Foreign Affairs. Booker, Harris, Amy Klobuchar, and Kirsten Gillibrand haven’t given any.) And of the senators running for president, <strong>Sanders owns the biggest foreign-policy victory of the last Congress: the vote to end U.S. funding for the Saudi war in Yemen</strong>.<br>
<br>
[...]<br>
<br>
What distinguishes Sanders is the same quality that distinguished him on domestic policy in 2016: his willingness to cross red lines that have long defined the boundaries of acceptable opinion. One clear example is Israel. Most of the Senate Democrats running for president have shifted left on the subject. Booker, after initially supporting legislation to criminalize boycotts of the Jewish state, voted against a similar bill last month. Warren, after defending Israeli military actions in the Gaza Strip earlier in her career, last year criticized Israel’s response to protests there. But Sanders has gone much further: He’s produced videos that call Gaza an “open-air prison,” he’s depicted Benjamin Netanyahu as part of the “growing worldwide movement toward authoritarianism,” and, most controversially of all, he’s suggested cutting U.S. military aid to Israel.<br>
<br>
[...]<br>
<br>
But Israel is only the beginning of Sanders’s sacrilege. He’s the only presidential candidate in recent memory who regularly describes the Cold War not as a heroic American victory, but as a cautionary tale. Sanders doesn’t just warn against U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, as Warren and Gillibrand have. He warns against it while invoking the United States’ “long history of inappropriately intervening in Latin American countries.” In his speech at Westminster College in 2017, he spent paragraph after paragraph detailing America’s disastrous 20th-century interventions: Iran, Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala, Vietnam—a litany that resembled a Noam Chomsky lecture more than a typical presidential candidate’s foreign-policy speech.<br>
<br>
[...]<br>
<br>
Sanders’s darker view of Cold War foreign policy isn’t mere historical revisionism. It’s linked to his critique of American foreign policy today. Now, as then, he wants America to shun the quest for global supremacy that leads it to overthrow regimes it can’t control and to instead pursue a foreign policy based on “partnership, rather than dominance.” That’s why, in his Westminster speech, Sanders did something Democrats have rarely done in recent decades: He called for putting the United Nations—which he called “one of the most important organizations for promoting a vision of a different world”—near the heart of American foreign policy.<br>
<br>
What all this represents is a second phase of the assault on American exceptionalism that Sanders launched in 2016. Back then, Sanders challenged the domestic side of the exceptionalist creed: the belief that American capitalism—buttressed by modest regulations and welfare provisions—provides upward mobility. Now Sanders is poised to challenge exceptionalism in foreign policy: the belief that America, as a uniquely virtuous nation, can substitute its own self-interest and moral intuition for international institutions and international law. Once again, Sanders’s heresies mirror the anti-exceptionalist turn among America’s young. A 2017 Pew Research poll found that Americans over the age of 30 were far more likely to say that the “U.S. stands above all other countries in the world” than to say, “There are other countries that are better than the U.S.” But among adults under 30, the latter view predominated by a margin of more than two to one.</blockquote>

This also makes me super excited about Bernie. What an absolute legend.

Even if we assume he has never done anything else in his life, moving the Overton window to the left so far that Democratic primary candidates are competing on universal healthcare and wealth taxes is an incredible achievement.

<br>
I became a leftist <strong>because</strong> I am a person of color who grew up poor in this shithole of a country. I trace my leftist politics back to the Black Panthers, to my grandparents and all the anti-colonial revolutionaries all around the world, and to all of us still fighting in America and abroad today. I see economic justice and social justice as inexorably bound together; wokeness alone won't feed you or give you shelter.<br>

And as Leslie Lee's article (and the #BernieMadeMeWhite hashtag) so rightfully points out: I am not alone and I am so sick of this.<br>

The saddest thing about this is if you associate leftist politics with white people, it's because America has done a stunning job killing and imprisoning leftist people of color in America and abroad.<br>

<blockquote>These questions are absurd. In what other job would we ask whether we should scrutinize the way a boss treats their staff? How could it not “matter” if a boss treats their staff like shit, whether they’re a politician or not? It sure as hell matters for the staff. This is the classic, Cillizza-esque analytical approach of politics reporters: Feeling unable to weigh in on whether something is actually good or bad, because that wouldn’t be Objective, they stick to analyzing whether it’ll affect electoral outcomes. That’s how you end up in the position of wondering how it’ll play in Peoria if Amy Klobuchar throws stuff at her staffers.<br>
<br>
What if, instead of approaching this story as a matter of political intrigue, we treated this story as it should be treated—as a labor story, a story of a shitty boss and workers who deserve better? In the American workplace, the boss has outsized power and workers have increasingly less. This is far more pressing in low-wage jobs, but it is also true in Congress, where staffers are underpaid and overworked and the boss is a member of the ruling elite. It says something important about Klobuchar’s understanding of labor rights—and her politics—if she abuses the power she has over her staff to demand they complete her menial personal errands, or screams at staffers for tiny errors. Does she think that other bosses have a right to treat their staffers the way she allegedly does? Does she understand how power operates in the workplace at all?</blockquote>

<br>
When Abrams tried to respond, Omar cut him off, saying, “That was not a question.”<br>
<br>
She then raised his dismissal of the 1981 El Mozote massacre, in which U.S.-trained Salvadoran soldiers murdered more than 800 civilians—part of a civil war Abrams described later as a “fabulous achievement.”<br>
<br>
“Yes or no,” Omar pointedly asked Abrams. “Do you think that massacre was a fabulous achievement, that happened under our watch?”<br>
<br>
Calling it a “ridiculous question,” Abrams insisted, “I’m not going to respond to that kind of personal attack, which is not a question.”<br>
<br>
“Yes or no,” Omar, undeterred, continued. “Would you support an armed faction within Venezuela that engages in war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide, if you believe they were serving U.S. interests, as you did in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua?” <br>

Smirking, Abrams responded that, “I don’t think this entire line of questioning is meant to be real questions, and so I will not reply.”<br>

Many of Schultz’s answers were terrible in part because he, personally, is clearly unprepared to be president.

<blockquote>While San Francisco had been a self-declared sanctuary city since the late 1980s, Harris came out publicly to support then-mayor Gavin Newsom’s 2008 policy in which undocumented minors would be handed over from police to ICE if they were arrested—even if those arrests never resulted in a conviction.<br>
<br>
“[San Francisco’s sanctuary status] was never intended to shield anyone from being held accountable for a crime,” Harris said at the time. “It’s intended to encourage immigrant victims and witnesses to report crimes without fear of reprisal so we can hold offenders accountable.”<br>
<br>
After just one year in place, according to CNN, the policy resulted in over 100 undocumented minors being turned over to ICE for deportation—some for arrests as minor as showing off a BB gun to a friend, or getting into a fight and stealing 46 cents. A year after the policy went into effect, the city’s board of supervisors passed a law which allowed police to hand over minors only if the juvenile in question had been convicted of a felony. Newsom—with Harris’ support—vetoed the new rule, but his veto was overturned.<br>
<br>
[...]<br>
<br>
This, however, gets to the heart of why so many on the left have been frustrated with Harris and her run for the White House—one which has brought her past as a hard-nosed prosecutor into direct conflict with a progressive base for whom cooperation with ICE is seen as anathema. Harris has already struggled to reconcile her “good cop” persona with a growing wing of the party leftists who see—among other things—abolishing ICE as an attainable goal, not just an aspirational slogan.<br>

In a letter shared by King on Tuesday, 200 hundred “pro-family leaders” have requested Republican minority leader Kevin McCarthy reinstate King to the House committees he’d been ignominiously—if very, very belatedly—dropped from in January, after publicly musing about how weird it is that phrases like “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization” are suddenly considered “offensive.”</blockquote>

There needs to be a more specific word than &quot;schadenfreude&quot; to describe the joy I feel when a gigantic racist is sad because he is shunned for abhorrent views. But I would ultimately rather want the gigantic racist to have no political power whatsoever.

<blockquote>I mean, there's not a campus-wide BDS movement for us to stop funding the war in Yemen. I don't see much left-wing energy spend on human rights in China. And the list goes on and on. Sure, there's a hard-core of anti-imperialist American left that's against all intervention; but I'm not really talking about them. I'm talking about exactly which foreign policy issues trickle up to mainstream consciousness in the U.S. I'm also not saying that it's wrong to campaign for Palestine in the US -- just that you are obligated to really, really think about and understand anti-semitism if you're going to wade into that fray.</blockquote>

If you actually aren't spending time in real life with leftists and are instead just picking up distorted fragments of it online, then you are going to get a very skewed picture of what we are fighting for and criticizing.<br>
<br>
Criticism of China and Saudi Arabia are not at all limited to &quot;the hard-core&quot; left. International solidarity is the norm in the circles I travel in and the publications I read. I can certainly agree that Saudi Arabia should get far more attention from everyone though.

<blockquote>Is this about criticizing Israel, or criticizing US foreign policy? The American Left's exclusive focus on Israel (while ignoring massive human rights abuses involved in the US's other alliances in the Middle East -- e.g., Saudi and Yemen -- in fact does raise the question of anti-semitism. If it's a question of Israel living up to its self-stated ideals, that seems to me more of an internal question for Israel. Let's look at ALL US intervention equally, and not focus on specific states or religions.</blockquote>

What circles of the &quot;American Left&quot; are you hanging out around exactly? Up until Khashoggi's murder, leftists have been pretty alone in criticizing Saudi Arabia's treatment of women and genocide in Yemen, particularly the arms deals under Obama and Trump that have enabled said genocide. It is frustrating to see how awful Saudi Arabia has to get before anyone else, whether it's liberals or conservatives, starts being critical of the kingdom.<br>
<br>
Even so, Saudi Arabia has not pushed for legislation that prevents Americans from criticizing or boycotting it. There are not ongoing coordinated campaigns of harassment against American college students and faculty for criticizing or boycotting Saudi Arabia. If there was and &quot;The American Left&quot; wasn't criticizing it, then you would certainly have a point that this is driven by anti-Semitism.<br>

I think Omar's biggest mistake is not letting <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/02/11/ilhan-omar-israel-lobby-documentary/">the Pro-Israel lobby literally speak for itself</a>:
<blockquote>David Ochs, founder of HaLev, which helps send young people to AIPAC’s annual conference, described for the reporter how AIPAC and its donors organize fundraisers outside the official umbrella of the organization, so that the money doesn’t show up on disclosures as coming specifically from AIPAC. He describes one group that organizes fundraisers in both Washington and New York. “This is the biggest ad hoc political group, definitely the wealthiest, in D.C.,” Ochs says, adding that it has no official name, but is clearly tied to AIPAC. “It’s the AIPAC group. It makes a difference, it really, really does. It’s the best bang for your buck and the networking is phenomenal.” (Ochs and AIPAC did not immediately return The Intercept’s requests for comment.)<br>
<br>
Without spending money, Ochs argues, the pro-Israel lobby isn’t able to enact its agenda. “Congressmen and senators don’t do anything unless you pressure them. They kick the can down the road, unless you pressure them, and the only way to do that is with money,” he explains.</blockquote>

<em>Besides, right now arguably the most successful leftist change is coming from progressive big city reformer prosecutors.</em><br>
<br>
Definitely, except there is a lot more that separates someone like Philadelphia's <a href="https://theslot.jezebel.com/who-is-kamala-harriss-new-memoir-for-1831585534">Larry Krasner</a> from Kamala Harris or Amy Klobuchar than geographic distance:
<blockquote>Harris’s progressive centrism, if you want to try to give it a name, is also less persuasive when held up against recent examples of what aggressive reform in the prosecutor’s office can look like in 2019. Take Philadelphia’s newly-elected District Attorney Larry Krasner. In his first months in office, Krasner, who campaigned on ending mass incarceration, made waves by firing a slew of prosecutors that he believed would resist his agenda and sent out a memo with a set of progressive directives for his entire staff, which included not prosecuting for marijuana possession without an intent to sell and not charging prostitution cases against sex workers for the first and second offense. (Even here, we see there is still a long way to go.) The memo also directed attorneys to state the projected cost of any prison sentence that they asked for in court. Krasner is new and still testing the limits of his job, but he’s presented a much more robust vision of what a progressive prosecutor should be.<br>
<br>
In contrast, Harris’s chapters on her prosecutorial record try to signal her progressivism, while carefully making sure not to alienate liberal and centrist voters—the type who feel might feel more comfortable when Harris describes her Back on Track program as a “boot camp,” noting that it was “not a social welfare program; it was a law enforcement program.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>If the surveillance powers of the NSA, FBI or other agencies were used to obtain incriminating information about Bezos due to their view of him as a political enemy – and, again, there is no evidence this has happened – it certainly would not be the first time. Those agencies have a long and shameful history of doing exactly that, which is why the Democratic adoration for those agencies, and the recent bipartisan further empowerment of them, was so disturbing.<br>
<br>
Indeed, one of the stories we were able to report using the Snowden documents, one that received less attention that it should have, is an active NSA program to collect the online sex activities, including browsing records of porn site and sex chats, of people regarded by the U.S. Government as radical or radicalizing in order to use their online sex habits to destroy their reputations. This is what and who the NSA, CIA and FBI are and long have been.<br>
<br>
[...]<br>
IF BEZOS WERE the political victim of surveillance state abuses, it would be scandalous and dangerous. It would also be deeply ironic.<br>
<br>
That’s because Amazon, the company that has made Bezos the planet’s richest human being, is a critical partner for the U.S. Government in building an ever-more invasive, militarized and sprawling surveillance state. Indeed, one of the largest components of Amazon’s business, and thus one of the most important sources of Bezos’ vast wealth and power, is working with the Pentagon and the NSA to empower the U.S. Government with more potent and more sophisticated weapons, including surveillance weapons.<br>
<br>
In December, 2017, Amazon boasted that it had perfected new face-recognition software for crowds, which it called Rekognition. It explained that the product is intended, in large part, for use by governments and police forces around the world. The ACLU quickly warned that the product is “dangerous” and that Amazon “is actively helping governments deploy it.”</blockquote>

This is one of those rare fights where I hope everyone loses. One benefit of Bezos becoming more and more of a public figure is that it will be easier for labor organizers and legislators to finally start making moves against Amazon's incredibly abusive and awful labor practices.

<em>About the socialism. In my European ears, the American use of &quot;socialism&quot; is always weird, though I'm getting less startled over time because of following these endless US politics threads. The way I understand it, socialism is about the workers taking over the means of production. And I'm actually against that, because I grew up seeing the poverty in the East Block. It wasn't working. (I'm not going to reply in any arguments about why it didn't work in this thread, because that is not where I am heading). Taxing the rich in order to provide welfare for everyone is social democracy. In that world view, the rich can do all the business they like, but they have to hand over a fair share of their earnings (like 70%) to society. The only reason I'm saying this -- obviously I can't police the American use of language -- is that maybe it would be helpful to frame it more like in Europe if you want to convince all those temporally embarrassed millionaires in the USA. <br>
BTW I often vote for Socialists here, when I feel the Social Democrats are too third wayish.<br>
</em><br>
<br>
The problem with social democracy is that without workers taking over those very means, even the most well-intentioned social democracies inevitably degrade back down to neoliberal shitholes.<br>
<br>
Soaking the rich is incredibly important, but if workers are still beholden to the scraps that the rich deign to provide them, what sort of freedom is that really?

<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/153087/trumps-attack-socialism-colossal-blunder">Trump’s Attack on Socialism Is a Colossal Blunder</a>:
<blockquote>Today, Trump is not only embracing the “rigged” system, but further owning his own unpopular economic policies, notably the $1.5 trillion tax cut he signed into law in December of 2017, which largely benefitted corporations and rich Americans. In the State of the Union, Trump boasted that “we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world.” But many Americans still aren’t feeling that heat, just as they weren’t in 2016. Most of the economic gains have gone to the top 20 percent, and wage growth, while ticking upward over the past six months, has been largely flat throughout most of the economic recovery. This, much more than Sanders, is why more Americans have warmed to socialism. “The prime mover of millions of Americans into the socialist column has been the near complete dysfunctionality of contemporary American capitalism,” argued Harold Meyerson in The Guardian.</blockquote>

<em>Totally fair to criticize her for this if you think that it would make more sense to push for bills that can't pass now, but she's pretty clearly saying -- and has previously said! -- that she supports the general ideas behind the Green New Deal and would support them in a bill that could get passed into law, which (in her view) is after 2020. This is a debate about political strategies and messaging, not about the need for climate change legislation.<br>
</em><br>
From a political strategy standpoint, this <strong>still</strong> seems like a significant misstep. So much of what can't pass now is also incredibly popular with American voters and is a significant reason behind AOC's electrifying popularity.<br>
<br>
If Pelosi and the rest of the establishment wants excited and engaged voters in 2020, especially those from the demographics most affected by climate change and lack of healthcare, she's not going to accomplish that by...not fighting for what they want and what is right, even if it can't pass right now. After all, with Trump as president and a Republican Senate, what exactly <em>can</em> pass right now?<br>

This political strategy only makes sense if Pelosi is worried about how the Democrats look to &quot;moderate&quot; Republicans who won't ever vote for them anyway.

As a person of color, I can't speak for everyone else, but Northam having been in blackface 35 years ago is a lot less abhorrent to me than how he handled that press conference and everything since. But then again, my expectations of what white people of all political stripes do and say around each other when they feel safe are rock bottom.<br>

As for Fairfax, a lot of liberal and leftist people of color feel deeply ambivalent (as in feeling strongly in both directions) about #MeToo because of the long history of policing, criminalization, and hypersexualization of people of color, particularly black men and women.

<a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/01/30/adam-smith-yemen-war/">Primaries Matter: How a Long-Shot Challenge Shifted the Debate on the War in Yemen</a>:
<blockquote>Since 2015, the United States has provided logistical support to Saudi Arabia, in addition to tens of billions of dollars in arms sales. The resolution, which seeks to end that, picked up momentum in the wake of the butchering of journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.<br>
<br>
But inside the House, a much lower-profile development played a critical but overlooked role: a Democratic primary campaign in Washington state. Significant credit for that resolution’s earlier momentum, say people closely involved in the process, belongs indirectly to Sarah Smith, a long-shot congressional candidate who challenged Democratic Rep. Adam Smith in Washington last year, making it to the general election before losing. Adam Smith at the time was the top-ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee and is now the panel’s chair, and Sarah Smith mounted her challenge largely in opposition to what she cast as his hawkish foreign policy approach, with a specific emphasis on Yemen.<br>
<br>
Adam Smith, facing the challenge from Sarah Smith, became an outspoken advocate of using the War Powers Resolution in the fall to go up against the Trump administration, including by becoming a leading sponsor of a new War Powers resolution on Yemen. Now that he has won re-election, he remains a supporter of the effort, but his enthusiasm for it has changed noticeably.</blockquote>

I don't think there has ever been a time where Democrats successfully owned Republicans with ironic bipartisanship. Pelosi's move also signals to everyone that the Republican frame of &quot;fiscal responsibility&quot; is the right one. Ugh.<br>

It's good to see progressive Dems try to keep Pelosi from continuing to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory with awful third way legislative priorities that most harm the poorest among us: <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/152811/left-taking-aim-pelosis-deficit-obsession">The Left Is Taking Aim at Pelosi’s Deficit Obsession</a>
<blockquote>Bivens highlights a remarkable stat: “If this public spending following the Great Recession had followed the average path of the recoveries of the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s, a full recovery with unemployment around 4 percent would have been achieved by 2013.”</blockquote>

Of course, this depends on centrist Democrats finally realizing the vast majority of voters who might vote for a Democrat don't care about deficits.

Some people were wondering if Mattis's &quot;Mad Dog&quot; nickname was just a harmless sobriquet...<a href="https://splinternews.com/hey-remember-how-james-mattis-was-accused-of-doing-war-1831256095">It's not</a>:
<blockquote>Retired Gen. James Mattis earned the nickname “Mad Dog” for leading U.S. Marines into battle in Fallujah, Iraq, in April 2004. <strong>In that assault, members of the Marine Corps, under Mattis’ command, shot at ambulances and aid workers. They cordoned off the city, preventing civilians from escaping. They posed for trophy photos with the people they killed</strong>.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
But before Mattis’ command in Iraq ended, he was involved in another controversial incident. On May 19, less than three weeks after his forces pulled back from Fallujah, <strong>Mattis personally authorized an attack on a wedding party near the Syrian border. The Iraqi government said the strike left 42 civilians dead, including at least 13 children.</strong><br>
<br>
The killings roiled Iraq, coming so soon after the carnage of Fallujah – but Mattis stood by his action, arguing the dead were insurgents.<br>
<br>
“How many people go to the middle of the desert … to hold a wedding 80 miles from the nearest civilization?” he told The Guardian. “These were more than two dozen military-age males. Let’s not be naive.”<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
In the years since, Mattis – called a “warrior monk” by his supporters – repeatedly has protected American service members who killed civilians, <strong>using his status as a division commander to wipe away criminal charges against Marines accused of massacring 24 Iraqi civilians in Haditha in 2005 and granting clemency to some of those convicted in connection with the 2006 murder of a 52-year-old disabled Iraqi, who was taken outside his home and shot in the face four times.</strong></blockquote>

As long as he says something mildly critical about Trump, I'm sure his place in #TheResistance is assured though.

I usually call him Condor Freedomdork, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/12/forever-war/578800/?utm_source=feed">but even a broken libertarian clock</a>...
<blockquote>And America’s ability to constructively debate the president’s actions is not helped by the fact that his corrupt political allies, dubious campaign behavior, opaque business empire, and bizarre behavior all raise the possibility that he is being blackmailed to act in the interest of Russia, Turkey or both.<br>
<br>
Even so, disdain for Trump and excessive deference to the foreign-policy establishment has caused much of the news media to err in its coverage—to treat the risky, costly, unconstitutional policy of maintaining a troop presence in Syria indefinitely as though it is obviously best, and to fail to treat the withdrawal of troops as a legitimate, reasonable position, even though it fulfills a campaign promise, enjoys popular support, remedies ongoing illegality, and has many plausible arguments that recommend it over quite unappealing alternatives.</blockquote>

<em>I know that we’ve been party to terrible, inhumane actions throughout our history, and have supported and propped up dictatorships, but it’s hard to wrap my head around the concreteness of our current reality versus the abstractness of history.</em><br>
<br>
Just like slavery and Jim Crow, this &quot;history&quot; isn't abstract to the millions of people who have suffered from it (and continue to suffer from it).<br>
<br>
And we're not even talking ancient history here. The Iraq War, with its very real death toll in the millions, started just 15 years ago. Obama murdered a teenage US citizen just 8 years ago while Trump murdered his 8 year old sister <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/01/30/obama-killed-a-16-year-old-american-in-yemen-trump-just-killed-his-8-year-old-sister/">last year</a>. Yemen has become a very concrete hellscape of death and starvation thanks to the Saudi fighter-bombers that Hillary Clinton sold as Secretary of State just 6 years ago.<br>
<br>
And some context to how America has treated &quot;our Kurdish allies&quot;: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_support_for_Iraq_during_the_Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War">the US provided material support to Saddam</a>, even when he was <strong>bombing the Kurds with chemical weapons</strong>.
<blockquote>The Reagan administration did not stop aiding Iraq after receiving reports affirming the use of poison gas on Kurdish civilians.<br>
<br>
Joost R. Hiltermann says that when the Iraqi military turned its chemical weapons on the Kurds during the war, killing approximately 5,000 people in the town of Halabja and injuring thousands more, the Reagan administration actually sought to obscure Iraqi leadership culpability by suggesting, inaccurately, that the Iranians may have carried out the attack.</blockquote>

<em>It's basically impossible to oppose the Administration on everything, because not *every* piece of legislation is stupid.<br>
</em><br>
<br>
Indeed, but there is a big difference between 13-14% and 30%.<br>
<br>
And the nature of what he voted for is even more important than those numbers:
<blockquote>For instance, O’Rourke was one of only a handful of House Democrats who voted for Republican bills to lift the 40-year-old oil export ban.<br>
<br>
During the legislative debate over lifting the ban, the Democrats’ committee report argued that “the extreme approach taken by this bill not only repeals current crude export restrictions, but also ensures that no export restrictions – for any reason – could be implemented or enforced in the future”. The Democratic report added that “the bill could have potentially vast consequences for consumers, the environment and climate change”.<br>
<br>
O’Rourke twice voted to lift the ban.<br>
<br>
At the same time, O’Rourke helped Republicans vote down Democratic legislation to prevent drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and he backed a separate GOP bill to speed up natural gas exports.<br>
<br>
He also supported GOP legislation that Democrats said was constructed to protect the utility industry. Republicans said the measure was designed “to ensure reliable electricity service and reduce the risk of fires and fire hazards caused by inadequate vegetation management” in areas where power lines cross federal lands. Repeating charges made by Democrats in the bill’s committee report, the Arizona Democratic representative Raúl Grijalva said during the floor debate: “The bill waives liability for companies that start forest fires or cause other damage. This is nonsense and shifts an incredible burden and risk on to American taxpayers.”<br>
<br>
O’Rourke was one of 69 Democrats to support the bill, which passed.</blockquote>

And that's just on what is relevant on climate change. The details of the actual article are pretty eye-opening and disappointing.

In February 1991, for example, a U.S. airstrike on an air-raid shelter in the Amiriyah neighborhood of Baghdad killed at least 408 Iraqi civilians. According to Human Rights Watch, the Pentagon knew the Amiriyah facility had been used as a civil-defense shelter during the Iran-Iraq war and yet had attacked without warning. It was, concluded HRW, “a serious violation of the laws of war.”</blockquote>

It is striking to see so much anguish about Trump and Bannon when so many of these same horrors have been carried out by far more civil and genteel war criminals (like Obama, Bush, Clinton, and every single person who has been president, along with eldritch ghouls like Kissinger). Of course, the difference is that the victims, while numbering in the tens of millions, had the terrible luck of being poor people of color in distant countries.<br>
<br>
Of course, Obama, the Clintons, and Kissinger are still invited to all the festivals and considered respectable.<br>

<em> Look... I feel pretty frickin liberal. But the concept of no police is not tenable in any society with complex laws and grey areas... I'm not saying that the police force we have is the correct model, but - none - that way leads to an absolute looting by the wealthy...</em> <br>
<br>
&quot;The police aren't that bad&quot; as a position is actually extremely &quot;frickin liberal&quot;.<br>
<br>
And the last century of absolute looting by the wealthy should be an excellent object lesson that the primary function of the police is to protect and further enrich the wealthy, not protect the rest of us from all that absolute looting. In just the past few decades, police militarization has gone hand-in-hand with massive transfers of wealth.<br>
<br>
Cops and prisons not only rarely do the job many of you think they are supposed to (preventing and addressing violent crime), <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/9/24/17896034/murder-crime-clearance-fbi-report">they are also incredibly bad at that job when they actually do it</a>, especially in communities of color. People of color and the poor are simultaneously overpoliced (when it comes to police harassment/violence/incarceration) and underpoliced (when it comes to actually preventing or addressing crime).<br>
<br>
In 2016, there were about 17,000 murders in the US. In that same year, there were nearly 37,000 fatalities from car crashes. 45,000 suicides. Almost 67,000 drug overdose deaths (over 72,000 in 2017!). Cops and prisons can't do shit for all those deaths (and generally make them worse!).<br>
<br>
If people are basing the importance of fundamentally racist and ineffectual institutions like cops and prisons on how they help catch sErIaL kILLeRs or mass shooters who have killed fewer people in the past century than drug overdoses have in just <em>this month</em>, then I shouldn't be surprised that so many of the replies believe that American policing can be reformed.

It is difficult to give someone the benefit of the doubt when they think it is &quot;far more likely&quot; that people who have experienced sexual assault are making it up.

<a href="https://www.metrotimes.com/table-and-bar/archives/2018/10/18/detroit-judge-tosses-gardening-while-black-case-brought-by-three-white-women">Meanwhile in Detroit</a>:
<blockquote>Throughout 2017 and early 2018, three white women called police dozens of times, making increasingly serious allegations against Marc Peeples, a black man. <br>
<br>
Peeples was building a community garden on the vacant Hunt Playground on Colton Street adjacent to the State Fairgrounds. One of the women, Deborah Nash, lives across the street from the park, while the others live nearby. <br>
<br>
Peeples said the women didn't like his project, so they began calling the police, fabricating serious charges when police wouldn't come out for illegal gardening allegations. Those culminated with allegations that Peeples was a pedophile, was in the park threatening Nash with a gun, and participated in a drive-by shooting. <br>
<br>
Eventually, the Detroit Police Department and Wayne County Prosecutors Office filed and brought three counts of stalking against Peeples. <br>
<br>
However, he and attorney Robert Burton-Harris said most of the allegations were false, and characterized Peeple's crime as &quot;gardening while black.&quot; <br>
<br>
36th District Court Judge E. Lynise Bryant agreed. She tossed the case on Tuesday, calling it &quot;troubling&quot; and &quot;ridiculous.&quot; </blockquote>

I don't read the definition as ambiguous? Especially since the same language is used in the definition for rape right above it.
<blockquote>Being made to penetrate someone else includes times when the victim was made to, or there was an attempt to make them, sexually penetrate someone without the victim’s consent because the victim was physically forced (such as being pinned or held down, or by the use of violence) or threatened with physical harm, or when the victim was drunk, high, drugged, or passed out and unable to consent.</blockquote>

Compare to the definition for rape:
<blockquote>Rape is defined as any completed or attempted unwanted vaginal (for women), oral, or anal penetration through the use of physical force (such as being pinned or held down, or by the use of violence) or threats to physically harm and includes times when the victim was drunk, high, drugged, or passed out and unable to consent. </blockquote>

I think a lot of people really don't understand just how many male sexual assault victims are out there because of this racialized and gendered perpetrator/victim binary.

Frobenius Twist, I don't think she is saying that racism is misandristic. I read that as she is talking about how this specific fear of hyper-sexualized boys and men of color involves both their race and their gender.<br>
<br>
I see racism hurting women and men of color in different ways. Like you said, forced sterilizations overwhelmingly affected women of color. In other avenues (like lynchings and up until recently, mass incarceration), men of color were the ones who were more likely to be affected. Abroad, we can see how the racism of America's neoconservative foreign policy has <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/05/under-obama-men-killed-by-drones-are-presumed-to-be-terrorists/257749/">turned every man of color in the wrong country into a presumed terrorist</a>.<br>
<br>
And on the point of amendments to this movement, I think the entire history of how people of color have been treated in this country is a clear example of why #MeToo has think way more seriously about race, incarceration, and criminalization. Otherwise, Carolyn Bryant's legacy lives on, albeit with a way more woke gilding.

As a person of color, a survivor of both sexual assault and racist violence, and someone who has personally witnessed how racialized false accusations have mobilized white communities to destroy POC lives, it is difficult for me to find a place in much of the hyper-polarized (and near-totally white) conversation around #MeToo. It is particularly ironic and frustrating given that the movement was started by Tarana Burke, a black woman.<br>
<br>
Along with this piece, I think Emily Yoffe at the Atlantic has done some of the most compelling reporting and writing that complicates #MeToo in ways that are completely necessary when we live in a world of white supremacy, patriarchy, and mass incarceration. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/09/the-question-of-race-in-campus-sexual-assault-cases/539361/">The statistics she has written about are staggering</a>:<br>
<br>
&gt; But the report did bring those statistics to light, a rarity. In the 2013–14 academic year, <strong>4.2 percent of Colgate’s students were black</strong>. According to the university’s records,<strong> in that year black male students were accused of 50 percent of the sexual violations reported to the university</strong>, and they made up 40 percent of the students formally adjudicated.<br>
<br>
During the three academic years from 2012–13 to 2014–15, black students were accused of 25 percent of the sexual misconduct reported to the university, and made up 21 percent of the students referred for formal hearings. Fifteen percent of the students found responsible for assault in those years were black. During that same three-year period, <strong>Asian students, who constituted a little more than 3 percent of Colgate’s student body in 2013, were more than 13 percent of the accused</strong>, 21 percent of those referred for hearings, and 23 percent of those found responsible.<br>
<br>
God, the world sucks so much.

It is striking and sad to see John McCain's most important legacy alive in all the ways liberals and centrists are paying him respect: he helped kill millions of people, but at least he respected norms.<br>
<br>
He helped wage what is effectively a slow motion genocide across the Middle East, but at least he criticized Trump sometimes (even though he still voted for the profoundly amoral and devastating tax cuts).<br>
<br>
The level of respect McCain got and continues to get from liberals and centrists just goes to show how deep and insidious white supremacy combined with neoliberalism and neoconservatism is. I don't think he would get this level of bipartisan support if he voted for a war that killed, say, 3 million Canadians.

<i>For those who don't want to be "Othered", there are a couple of strategies: one is living in a specific ethnic enclave. Lots of people do this.

<i>Doesn't it matter if the person commenting on your name is just trying to be friendly, or make small talk? Honest question - doesn't intent in a situation like this matter?</i><br>
<br>
How can I tell someone's intent? I have lived among the white tribes of North America for decades and despite studying them very closely, I have yet to find a small light on the back of a person's neck that tells me if they're asking about or commenting on my name out of a desire to figure out how most effectively put me in a foreign, exotic box of stereotypes (which has everything to do with my race) or out of well-intentioned, genuine curiosity (which...still has everything to do with my race).<br>
<br>
And even if I could tell, this consideration of intent you're asking about is just another disparity I would experience solely due to my skin color.<br>
<br>
Again, there are just so many ways to be friendly or to make small talk. It isn't as though people interact and meet in voids lacking all social context. Ask about who they know at the party. Ask about what they're doing in life. Ask about what they're passionate about. Ask where their favorite brunch spot is in town. The possibilities are endless and none of them have to involve subtle degradation!

<br>
I think physical violence and misogyny are two very different things though. Violence takes a whole lot more effort (and has real legal repercussions) than simply being a person who holds misogynistic or racist attitudes. This is especially true right now, where so much misogyny and racism is implicit as opposed to explicit.<br>
<br>
Moreover, vocally criticizing things misogyny or racism will never lead to our precious games being taken away or something; it will just lead to less shitty games.

There are big differences between Bioshock and Saint's Row, but the key issue is that when it comes to the portrayal and representation of women in video games, we've got 99 <em>Hostel Part II</em> for every 1 <em>The Godfather</em>.<br>
<br>
But when the ratio is that stark, the very few exceptions to the trend ultimately get subsumed by the trend itself.  Released in a culture where women are so consistently and continuously objectified, Bioshock is consumed no differently than Saint's Row. The only difference is plausible deniability.<br>
<br>
However, thanks to so much awesome discussion and criticism in recent years, I think we're reaching a point where games will open up like movies did.

Thanks lodurr! I'm a bit new at this whole MeFi thing:)<br>
<br>
Looking at all of these examples that I've personally played, I don't remember even one example where the portrayal of women as background/sexualized objects as a positive contribution to my experience of that game. All it's ever done for me is give me something to eyeroll/groan at for a second.<br>
<br>
My greatest memories have been all about <strong>gameplay</strong>; the dodging and weaving in The Binding of Isaac or jumping out of a helicopter in Battlefield and shooting a rocket to blow up the jet tailing me. I think about the perfectly timed counter with Marth that changed everything in a match I was badly losing.<br>
<br>
When I remember my favorite moments in gaming, I remember the amazing interplay between complex gameplay systems and mechanisms. <br>
<br>
And when I see objectification in games, I see money and effort wasted and lost. Those dollars and hours could have gone to create better gameplay.<br>
<br>
Then again, I am not in that highly sought after target demographic.

This was a great read and something I've always wondered about. As the article notes, there are definitely spaces and contexts to excoriate liberals as handily as conservatives. But I think that really exists on the specific level.<br>
<br>
Zoomed out, I think it is very tricky to effectively navigate humor on liberal/progressive issues. In 2014, how do you make a joke about how two hundred fifty years of slavery (and ninety subsequent years of state-santcioned domestic terrorism) weren't that bad? <br>
<br>
And that right there is why I think we don't see very many conservative comedians standing out in public discourse.<br>
<br>
Thank fucking goodness.

When a white guy violently deprives women of their lives and education, it's mental illness. When men of color violently deprive women of their lives and education, it's Boko Haram.<br>
<br>
The only difference I see is degree, race, and place. Sigh.

<em>&quot;would you support a proposal that america nationalize several big banks, goldman sachs and jpmorgan chase for starters, and hand their equity over to impoverished inner-city black people? that's where all the money went during the bailout, which could have gone to universal healthcare, green energy or quality education for all. tell me why not!&quot;&quot;</em><br>
<br>
Wait, are you saying all the bailout money went to &quot;impoverished inner-city black people&quot; or are you saying all the bailout money went to several big banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase?<br>
<br>
If it's the former, that's not how I (or the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/national/200904_CREDITCRISIS/recipients.html">New York Times</a>) remember it going down.<br>
<br>
The funny thing is that if you read the article, Ta-Nehisi Coates connects the story to even the 2008 financial crisis that you're bringing up.

And from the article, Coates notes that Germany agreed to reparations for the Holocaust. Germany did so while having a non-trivial segment of their population think &quot;'that the Jews themselves were partly responsible for what happened to them during the Third Reich.'&quot;<br>
<br>
Like fuck, if that doesn't just <em>scream</em> how utterly screwed America is with coming to terms with slavery, I don't know what will.

When I hear people talk about how reparations can't happen because the money isn't there, this is all I'm seeing:<br>
<br>
&quot;America's debt is important and real! Except for when we're talking about the debt America owes to the people it literally enslaved and terrorized for centuries. That debt doesn't count.&quot;

I wish the BJP and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_National_Party">BNP</a> could get thrown into a pit so we could all just watch the one spectacle that will leave the world better off. Modi can talk about economic development all he wants, but all the money can't paint over sectarian violence and discrimination. TNR just posted <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/117783/narendra-modis-election-and-future-india">a piece that describes Modi perfectly</a>:
<blockquote>He is a depressingly familiar type. He is secretive; he is vindictive; he has creepily authoritarian tendencies (a woman in Gujarat was placed under surveillance by Modi for months in a controversy that somehow didn't seem to register with voters); he ricochets between aggression and self-pity in a manner familiar to anyone who has heard nationalists of any stripe; and he is simply incapable of sounding broad-minded. During the 2002 Gujarat riots, hundreds of people (mostly Muslims) were killed in communal violence on Modi's watch. (This is why he has been denied a United States visa for many years.) The extent of Modi's role in spurring on the horrors has been extensively debated; suffice it to say that he once said his only regret about the mass murders was that he didn't handle the media well enough.</blockquote>

<em>The PHS research involved intentionally exposing and infecting vulnerable populations to sexually transmitted diseases without the subjects’ consent.</em><br>
<br>
Ugh. What worries me is that this, just like entrenched racism in America, may be viewed as something that dwells in the past as opposed to something that lives on today, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/02/testing-drugs-on-the-developing-world/273329/">albeit in a slightly different form</a>.<br>
<br>
When colonialism and neoliberalism hold hands and press down upon already suffering peoples, &quot;voluntary&quot; ain't an adjective.

I don't think it's just that Lucas can't write recognizably human characters, but also that he's awful at variety and diversity in terms of gender. I love Star Wars, but that's something that bothers me about the whole thing (and most sci fi/fantasy that isn't by Iain M Banks or China Mieville).

Guns have done reprehensible things, but they're nothing compared to late capitalism and the war on drugs. How come we can't have mainstream conversations about banning those damned things?
